      "In an analysis of adverse reactions of composite Phase 3 studies with ZYTIGA, adverse reactions that were observed in \u226510% of patients were peripheral oedema, hypokalaemia, hypertension urinary tract infection, and alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased.",
      "Other important adverse reactions include, cardiac disorders, hepatotoxicity, fractures, and allergic alveolitis.",
      "ZYTIGA may cause hypertension, hypokalaemia and fluid retention as a pharmacodynamic consequence of its mechanism of action. In Phase 3 studies, anticipated mineralocorticoid adverse reactions were seen more commonly in patients treated with abiraterone acetate than in patients treated with placebo: hypokalaemia 18% vs.8%, hypertension 22% vs. 16% and fluid retention (peripheral oedema) 23% vs. 17%, respectively. In patients treated with abiraterone acetate, CTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypokalaemia were observed in 6% and 2% of patients, CTCAE (version 4.0) Grades 3 and 4 hypertension were observed in 8% and 5% of patients, and fluid retention (peripheral oedema) Grades 3 and 4 were observed in 1% and 1% of patients, respectively. Mineralocorticoid reactions generally were able to be successfully managed medically. Concomitant use of a corticosteroid reduces the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\t\t",
      "In studies of patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer who were using an LHRH analogue, or were previously treated with orchiectomy, ZYTIGA was administered at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in combination with low dose prednisone or prednisolone (either 5 or 10 mg daily depending on the indication).",
      "Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies and post-marketing experience are listed below by frequency category. Frequency categories are defined as follows: very common (\u2265 1/10); common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data).",
      "Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.",
      "The following CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 3 adverse reactions occurred in patients treated with abiraterone acetate: hypokalaemia 5%; urinary tract infection 2%; alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased 4%; hypertension 6%; fractures 2%; peripheral oedema, cardiac failure, and atrial fibrillation 1% each. CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 3 hypertriglyceridaemia and angina pectoris occurred in < 1% of patients. CTCAE (version 4.0) Grade 4 urinary tract infection, alanine aminotransferase increased and/or aspartate aminotransferase increased, hypokalemia, cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, and fractures occurred in < 1% of patients.",
      "A higher incidence of hypertension and hypokalemia was observed in the hormone sensitive population (study 3011). Hypertension was reported in 36.7% of patients in the hormone sensitive population (study 3011) compared to 11.8% and 20.2% in studies 301 and 302, respectively. Hypokalemia was observed in 20.4% of patients in the hormone sensitive population (study 3011) compared to 19.2% and 14.9% in 301 and 302, respectively).",
      "The incidence and severity of adverse events was higher in the subgroup of patients with baseline ECOG2 performance status grade and also in elderly patients (\u226575 years ).",

All patients enrolled (both active and placebo-treated patients) were concomitantly treated with androgen deprivation therapy, predominantly with the use of LHRH analogues, which has been associated with diabetes, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident and sudden cardiac death. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse reactions in the Phase 3 studies in patients taking abiraterone acetate versus patients taking placebo were as follows: atrial fibrillation 2.6% vs. 2.0%, tachycardia 1.9% vs. 1.0%, angina pectoris 1.7% vs. 0.8%, cardiac failure 0.7% vs. 0.2%, and arrhythmia 0.7% vs. 0.5%.",
      "\n\t\t\tHepatotoxicity\n\t\t",
      "Hepatotoxicity with elevated ALT, AST and total bilirubin has been reported in patients treated with abiraterone acetate. Across Phase 3 clinical studies, hepatotoxicity grades 3 and 4 (e.g., ALT or AST increases of > 5 x ULN or bilirubin increases > 1.5 x ULN) were reported in approximately 6% of patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. In Study 3011, grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity was observed in 8.4% of patients treated with ZYTIGA. Ten patients who received ZYTIGA were discontinued because of hepatotoxicity; two had Grade 2 hepatotoxicity, six had Grade 3 hepatotoxicity, and two had Grade 4 hepatotoxicity. No patient died of hepatotoxicity in Study 3011. In the Phase 3 clinical studies, patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver function test elevations than those beginning with normal values. When elevations of either ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, or elevations in bilirubin > 3 x ULN were observed, abiraterone acetate was withheld or discontinued. In two instances marked increases in liver function tests occurred (see section 4.4). These two patients with normal baseline hepatic function, experienced ALT or AST elevations 15 to 40 x ULN and bilirubin elevations 2 to 6 x ULN. Upon discontinuation of treatment, both patients had normalisation of their liver function tests and one patient was re-treated without recurrence of the elevations. In study 302, Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations were observed in 35 (6.5%) patients treated with abiraterone acetate. Aminotransferase elevations resolved in all but 3 patients (2 with new multiple liver metastases and 1 with AST elevation approximately 3 weeks after the last dose of abiraterone acetate). In Phase 3 clinical studies, treatment discontinuations due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function were reported in 1.1% of patients treated with abiraterone acetate and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo; no deaths were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.",
      "In clinical trials, the risk for hepatotoxicity was mitigated by exclusion of patients with baseline hepatitis or significant abnormalities of liver function tests. In the 3011 trial, patients with baseline ALT and AST > 2.5 X ULN, bilirubin > 1.5 X ULN or those with active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease; ascites or bleeding disorders secondary to hepatic dysfunction were excluded. In the 301 trial, patients with baseline ALT and AST \u2265 2.5 x ULN in the absence of liver metastases and > 5 x ULN in the presence of liver metastases were excluded. In the 302 trial, patients with liver metastases were not eligible and patients with baseline ALT and AST \u2265 2.5 x ULN were excluded. Abnormal liver function tests developing in patients participating in clinical trials were vigorously managed by requiring treatment interruption and permitting re-treatment only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline (see section 4.2). Patients with elevations of ALT or AST > 20 x ULN were not re-treated. The safety of re-treatment in such patients is unknown. The mechanism for hepatotoxicity is not understood.",

      "Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Lixiana may be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 Management of bleeding). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (e.g. epistaxis, gastrointestinal, genitourinary) and anaemia were seen more frequently during long term edoxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see Haemorrhagic risk in section 4.4). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea, and unexplained shock.",

      "The combination of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil has been studied in 460 patients either as the fixed-dose combination tablet Atripla (study AI266073) or as the component products (study GS-01-934).  Adverse reactions were generally consistent with those seen in previous studies of the individual components.  The most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to Atripla among patients treated up to 48 weeks in study AI266073 were psychiatric disorders (16%), nervous system disorders (13%), and gastrointestinal disorders (7%).",
      "Severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme; neuropsychiatric adverse reactions (including severe depression, death by suicide, psychosis-like behaviour, seizures); severe hepatic events; pancreatitis and lactic acidosis (sometimes fatal) have been reported.",
      "Rare events of renal impairment, renal failure and uncommon events of proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) sometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) have also been reported.  Monitoring of renal function is recommended for patients receiving Atripla (see section 4.4).",
      "Discontinuation of Atripla therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis (see section 4.4).",
      "The administration of Atripla with food may increase efavirenz exposure and may lead to an increase in the frequency of adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).",
      "\n\t\t\tTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\t\t",
      "The adverse reactions from clinical study and post-marketing experience with Atripla and the individual components of Atripla in antiretroviral combination therapy are listed in Table 2 below by body system organ class, frequency and the component(s) of Atripla to which the adverse reactions are attributable.  Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.  Frequencies are defined as very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).",

      "\n\t\t\t Anaemia was common and skin discolouration (increased pigmentation) was very common when emtricitabine was administered to paediatric patients.",
      "\n\t\t\t This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy.  It is not considered to be causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil in the absence of this condition.",
      "\n\t\t\t See section 4.8 Description of selected adverse reactions for more details.",
      "\n\t\t\t This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for either efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil.  The frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients treated with efavirenz in clinical trials (n = 3,969) or exposed to emtricitabine in randomised controlled clinical trials (n = 1,563) or exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical trials and the expanded access programme (n = 7,319).",
      "\n\t\t\tDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\t\t",
      "\n\t\t\tRash: In clinical trials of efavirenz, rashes were usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occurred within the first two weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz.  In most patients rash resolved with continuing therapy with efavirenz within one month.  Atripla can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash.  Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when Atripla is restarted.",
      "\n\t\t\tPsychiatric symptoms: Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders appear to be at greater risk of serious psychiatric adverse reactions listed in the efavirenz column of Table 2.",
      "\n\t\t\tNervous system symptoms: Nervous system symptoms are common with efavirenz, one of the components of Atripla.  In clinical controlled studies of efavirenz, nervous system symptoms of moderate to severe intensity were experienced by 19% (severe 2%) of patients, and 2% of patients discontinued therapy due to such symptoms.  They usually begin during the first one or two days of efavirenz therapy and generally resolve after the first two to four weeks.  They may occur more frequently when Atripla is taken concomitantly with meals possibly due to increased efavirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2).  Dosing at bedtime seems to improve the tolerability of these symptoms (see section 4.2).",
      "\n\t\t\tHepatic failure with efavirenz: Hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, as reported post-marketing, were sometimes characterised by a fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death.",
      "\n\t\t\tRenal impairment: As Atripla may cause renal damage, monitoring of renal function is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 Summary of the safety profile).  Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  However, in some patients, declines in creatinine clearance did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  Patients at risk of renal impairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete recovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tInteraction with didanosine: Co-administration of Atripla and didanosine is not recommended as it results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-related adverse reactions (see section 4.5).  Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported.",
      "\n\t\t\tMetabolic parameters: Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tImmune Reactivation Syndrome: In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise.  Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tOsteonecrosis: Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tPaediatric population\n\t\t",

      "\n\t\t\tOther special populations\n\t\t",
      "\n\t\t\tElderly: Atripla has not been studied in patients over the age of 65.  Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic or renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients with Atripla (see section 4.2).",
      "\n\t\t\tPatients with renal impairment: Since tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is recommended in any patient with mild renal impairment treated with Atripla (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).",
      "\n\t\t\tHIV/HBV or HCV co-infected patients: Only a limited number of patients were co-infected with HBV (n = 13) or HCV (n = 26) in study GS-01-934.  The adverse reaction profile of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil in patients co-infected with HIV/HBV or HIV/HCV was similar to that observed in patients infected with HIV without co-infection.  However, as would be expected in this patient population, elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently than in the general HIV infected population.",

The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients included: headache, anaemia, decreased appetite, insomnia, cough, nausea, diarrhoea, alopecia, pruritus, myalgia, pyrexia, fatigue, influenza-like illness, asthenia, chills and peripheral oedema.",
      "In 2 controlled clinical studies, 171 chronic paediatric ITP patients were treated with eltrombopag. The median duration of exposure was 171 days. The profile of adverse reactions was comparable to that seen in adults with some additional adverse reactions, marked ",

The most common adverse reactions in paediatric ITP patients 1 year and older (\u2265 3% and greater than placebo) were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, cough, diarrhoea, pyrexia, rhinitis, abdominal pain, oropharyngeal pain, toothache, rash, increased AST and rhinorrhoea.",

The most important serious adverse reactions identified were hepatotoxicity and thrombotic/thromboembolic events. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients included: headache, anaemia, decreased appetite, insomnia, cough, nausea, diarrhoea, alopecia, pruritus, myalgia, pyrexia, fatigue, influenza-like illness, asthenia, chills and peripheral oedema.",
      "The safety of eltrombopag in severe aplastic anaemia was assessed in a single-arm, open-label trial (N=43) in which 12 patients (28%) were treated for > 6 months and 9 patients (21%) were treated for > 1 year. The most important serious adverse reactions were febrile neutropenia and sepsis/infection. The most common adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients included: headache, dizziness, insomnia, cough, dyspnoea, oropharyngeal pain, rhinorrhoea, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, transaminases increased, ecchymosis, arthralgia, muscle spasms, pain in extremity, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, and pyrexia.",

      "In a placebo-controlled study (n=288, Safety population), following 2 weeks treatment in preparation for invasive procedures, 6 of 143 (4%) adult patients with chronic liver disease receiving eltrombopag experienced 7 TEEs of the portal venous system and 2 of 145 (1%) subjects in the placebo group experienced 3 TEEs. Five of the 6 patients treated with eltrombopag experienced the TEE at a platelet count > 200,000/\u00b5l",

Portal vein thrombosis was the most common TEE in both treatment groups (2% in patients treated with eltrombopag versus < 1% for placebo) (see section 4.4). Patients with low albumin levels (\u2264 35 g/L) or MELD \u2265 10 had a twofold greater risk of TEEs than those with higher albumin levels; those aged \u2265 60 years had a 2-fold greater risk of TEEs compared to younger patients.",

In 2 controlled clinical studies in thrombocytopenic patients with HCV, hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal haemorrhage, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) was reported more frequently in the eltrombopag arm (11%) than in the placebo arm (6%). In patients with low albumin levels (\u2264 35 g/L) or MELD score \u2265 10 at baseline, there was a three-fold greater risk of hepatic decompensation and an increase in the risk of a fatal adverse event compared to those with less advanced liver disease. Eltrombopag should only be administered to such patients after careful consideration of the expected benefits in comparison with the risks. Patients with these characteristics should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatic decompensation (see section 4.4).",

Patients should be instructed to stop the medicinal product and seek medical attention if they develop severe constipation for more than 4 days (see section 4.4).",

All events resolved upon discontinuation of Truberzi, with symptoms typically improved by the following day. All events of sphincter of Oddi spasm occurred in patients without a gallbladder. Therefore, eluxadoline is contraindicated in this population as well as in those with previous biliary tract problems (see sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4). The occurrence of such events in patients with an intact biliary tract cannot be excluded.",

Of the 5 cases reported, 3 were associated with excessive alcohol intake, 1 was associated with biliary sludge, and in one case the patient discontinued eluxadoline 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. ",
      "All pancreatic events, whether or not associated with sphincter of Oddi spasm, were retrospectively evaluated as mild, indicating an absence of organ failure and local or systemic complications. All pancreatic events resolved with lipase normalization upon discontinuation of eluxadoline, with 80% (4/5) resolving within 1 week of treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4).",

      "There was an overall increased frequency of adverse events in the older population compared to patients <65 years which was comparable across all treatment groups, including placebo.",
      "The frequency of serious adverse events, gastrointestinal events, and events leading to discontinuation tended to be lower for the 75 mg dose compared to the 100 mg dose. Therefore, in this population, the 75 mg dose twice daily can be used. (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).",

Relative to the adverse reactions noted in section b. Tabulated list of adverse reactions, one additional adverse reaction [decrease in blood bicarbonate (2%)] was observed in entecavir-treated patients through week 48. The on-study cumulative death rate was 23% (23/102), and causes of death were generally liver-related, as expected in this population. The on-study cumulative rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 12% (12/102). Serious adverse events were generally liver-related, with an on-study cumulative frequency of 69%. Patients with high baseline CTP score were at higher risk of developing serious adverse events (see section 4.4).",

      "\n\t\t\tSummary of the safety profile\n\t\t",
      "Acute pancreatitis is a serious adverse reaction and is attributed to the alogliptin component of Vipdomet (see section 4.4). Hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anaphylactic reactions, and angioedema are serious and are attributed to the alogliptin component of Vipdomet (see section 4.4). Lactic acidosis is a serious adverse reaction, which may occur very rarely (<1/10,000), and is attributed to the metformin component of Vipdomet (see section 4.4). Other reactions such as upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, pruritus, rash, hypoglycaemia may occur commonly (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10) (see section 4.4) which are attributed to Vipdomet.",
      "Clinical studies conducted to support the efficacy and safety of Vipdomet involved the co-administration of alogliptin and metformin as separate tablets. However, the results of bioequivalence studies have demonstrated that Vipdomet film-coated tablets are bioequivalent to the corresponding doses of alogliptin and metformin co-administered as separate tablets.",
      "The information provided is based on a total of 7,150 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, including 4,201 patients treated with alogliptin and metformin, who participated in 7 phase 3 double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled clinical studies. These studies evaluated the effects of co-administered alogliptin and metformin on glycaemic control and their safety as initial combination therapy, as dual therapy in patients initially treated with metformin alone, and as add-on therapy to a thiazolidinedione or insulin.",
      "\n\t\t\tTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\t\t",
      "The adverse reactions are listed by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from available data).",
      "\n\t\t\tDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\t\t",
      "Lactic acidosis: 0.03 cases/1,000 patient-years (see section 4.4).",
      "Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 absorption and appears generally to be without clinical significance. However, it may very rarely result in clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency (e.g. megaloblastic anaemia).",
      "Gastrointestinal symptoms occur most frequently during initiation of therapy and resolve spontaneously in most cases. These may be prevented by taking metformin in 2 daily doses during or after meals.",
      "Isolated cases of hepatitis or liver function test abnormalities resolving on discontinuation of metformin have been reported.",

The highest risk for SJS and TEN, or other serious hypersensitivity reactions, is within the first weeks of treatment. The best results in managing such reactions come from early diagnosis and immediate discontinuation of any suspect drug. Allopurinol should be withdrawn immediately should such reactions occur.  After recovery, from mild reactions allopurinol may, if desired, be re-introduced at a small dose (e.g. 50 mg/day) and gradually increased. The HLA-B*5801 allele has been shown to be associated with the risk of developing allopurinol related hypersensitivity syndrome and SJS/TEN. The use of genotyping as a screening tool to make decisions about treatment with allopurinol has not been established. If the rash recurs, allopurinol should be permanently withdrawn as more severe hypersensitivity may occur (see section 4.8 Immune system disorders). If SJS/TEN, or other serious hypersensitivity reactions cannot be ruled out, DO NOT re-introduce allopurinol due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction. The clinical diagnosis of SJS/TEN remains the basis for decision making. If such reactions occur at any time during treatment, allopurinol should be withdrawn immediately and permanently",

The basis of assessment of causality between the adverse drug reactions and SIRTURO was not restricted to these trials, but also on review of the pooled Phase I and Phase IIa safety data. The most frequent adverse drug reactions (> 10.0% of patients) during treatment with SIRTURO in the controlled trials were nausea (35.3% in the SIRTURO group vs 25.7% in the placebo group), arthralgia (29.4% vs 20.0%), headache (23.5% vs 11.4%), vomiting (20.6% vs 22.9%) and dizziness (12.7% vs 11.4%).

The largest mean increase from baseline values in QTcF during the 24 weeks of SIRTURO treatment was 15.7 ms (at week 18). After the end of SIRTURO treatment (i.e. after week 24), QTcF increases in the SIRTURO group gradually became less pronounced. The largest mean increase from baseline values in QTcF in the placebo group during the first 24 weeks was 6.2 ms (also at week 18) (see section 4.4).",
      "In the Phase IIb, open label study (C209), where patients with no treatment options received other QT-prolonging medicinal products used to treat tuberculosis, including clofazimine, concurrent use with SIRTURO resulted in additive QT prolongation, proportional to the number of QT prolonging medicinal products in the treatment regimen.",
      "Patients receiving SIRTURO alone with no other QT prolonging medicinal product developed a maximal mean QTcF increase over baseline of 23.7 ms with no QT duration in excess of 480 ms, whereas patients with at least 2 other QT prolonging medicinal products developed a maximal mean QTcF prolongation of 30.7 ms over baseline, resulting in a QTcF duration in excess of 500 ms in one patient.",

In the SIRTURO treatment group, the majority of these increases occurred throughout the 24 weeks of treatment and were reversible. During the investigational phase in Stage 2 of study C208, increased aminotransferases were reported in 7/79 (8.9%) patients in the SIRTURO treatment group compared to 1/81 (1.2%) in the placebo treatment group.",

ADRs usually occur within the first month of therapy and are generally reversible. Approximately 8% of patients had a severe ADR (common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 3 or 4). Approximately 3% of patients stopped therapy due to an ADR.",

      "In the ISEL trial, the incidence of ILD-type events in the overall population was approximately 1% in both treatment arms. The majority of ILD-type events reported was from patients of Asian ethnicity and the ILD incidence among patients of Asian ethnicity receiving gefitinib therapy and placebo was approximately 3% and 4% respectively. One ILD-type event was fatal, and this occurred in a patient receiving placebo.",
      "In a post-marketing surveillance study in Japan (3350 patients) the reported rate of ILD-type events in patients receiving gefitinib was 5.8%. The proportion of ILD-type events with a fatal outcome was 38.6%.",

When considering the cases of tumours occurring in the different organ systems, the relative risk associated with dapagliflozin was above 1 for some tumours (bladder, prostate, breast) and below 1 for others (e.g. blood and lymphatic, ovary, renal tract), not resulting in an overall increased tumour risk associated with dapagliflozin. The increased/decreased risk was not statistically significant in any of the organ systems. Considering the lack of tumour findings in non-clinical studies as well as the short latency between first drug exposure and tumour diagnosis, a causal relationship is considered unlikely.

The total mean treatment duration for subjects was 95.3 weeks. The most frequent adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and as spontaneous reports are diarrhoea, nausea, rash, headache and vomiting. The most frequent serious reactions are acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, diarrhoea, hepatitis and pyrexia.",

The imbalance occurred as early as the first 26 weeks of therapy. Patients in CANVAS and CANVAS-R were followed for an average of 5.7 and 2.1 years, respectively. Regardless of treatment with canagliflozin or placebo, the risk of amputation was highest in patients with a baseline history of prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, and neuropathy. The risk of lower limb amputation was not dose-dependent. The amputation results for the Integrated CANVAS Program are shown in table 2. In other type 2 diabetes studies with canagliflozin, which enrolled a general diabetic population of 8,114 patients, no difference in lower limb amputation risk was observed relative to control.",
      "Of the subjects who had an amputation, the toe and midfoot were the most frequent sites (71%) in both treatment groups (see table 2). Multiple amputations (some involving both lower limbs) were observed infrequently and in similar proportions in both treatment groups.",

The incidence with canagliflozin treatment in the two active-controlled studies was similar to comparators.",
      "In one of the dedicated long-term cardiovascular studies (CANVAS), where patients were generally older with a higher rate of diabetes complications, the incidence rates of adverse reactions related to volume depletion were 2.3 with canagliflozin 100 mg, 2.9 with canagliflozin 300 mg, and 1.9 with placebo, events per 100 patient-years.",
      "To assess risk factors for these adverse reactions, a larger pooled analysis (N = 12,441) of patients from 13 controlled phase 3 and phase 4 studies including both doses of canagliflozin was conducted. In this pooled analysis, patients on loop diuretics, patients with a baseline eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m, and patients \u2265 75 years of age had generally higher incidences of these adverse reactions. For patients on loop diuretics, the incidence rates were 5.0 on canagliflozin 100 mg and 5.7 on canagliflozin 300 mg compared to 4.1 events per 100 patient-years of exposure in the control group.

      "Serious hepatic toxicity caused by ketoconazole treatment is rare (1/15000). Acute hepatocellular injury has been primarily observed as has cholestatic injury or a mixed pattern of toxicity. Fatal cases have been reported particularly when treatment is continued despite liver enzyme elevation. Increases in liver enzymes (\u2264 5N and > 5N) were observed in ~13.5 % and ~2.5% of patients respectively occurring mostly within the first 6 months of treatment. Liver enzyme levels returned to normal within 2-12 weeks after a dose decrease or withdrawal of ketoconazole. Hepatotoxicity does not appear to be dose dependent. All potential associated factors of hepatotoxicity, and abnormal liver enzyme levels detected before Ketoconazole HRA initiation, should be taken into account before considering Ketoconazole HRA treatment. Ketoconazole HRA should not be administered when liver enzymes are greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal or in association with other hepatotoxic drugs. Liver enzyme monitoring should be performed once weekly during the first month of treatment and then monthly for 6 months. In the case an increase of liver enzymes is detected which is less than 3 times the upper limit of normal, closer monitoring of liver function should be performed and the daily dose should be decreased by at least 200 mg. In the case of increase of liver enzymes levels above 3 times the upper limit of normal, Ketoconazole HRA should be stopped immediately and should not be reintroduced because of the risk of serious hepatic toxicity.",

Monitor and instruct patients on the signs and symptoms associated with hypocortisolism (e.g. weakness, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hyperkalemia, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia or hypoglycaemia). Adrenal insufficiency may be detected by periodic clinical assessment and monitoring of plasma/serum or salivary cortisol levels.

Ketoconazole was stopped but she deteriorated rapidly and died. A 17 years old girl was treated on ketoconazole 1200 mg/day for an adrenal carcinoma with liver metastasis and had altered liver function tests at 22 days.

      "In clinical trials in CML, drug discontinuation for drug-related adverse reactions was observed in 2.4% of newly diagnosed patients, 4% of patients in late chronic phase after failure of interferon therapy, 4% of patients in accelerated phase after failure of interferon therapy and 5% of blast crisis patients after failure of interferon therapy. In GIST the study drug was discontinued for drug-related adverse reactions in 4% of patients.",
      "The adverse reactions were similar in all indications, with two exceptions. There was more myelosuppression seen in CML patients than in GIST, which is probably due to the underlying disease. In the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, 7 (5%) patients experienced CTC grade 3/4 GI bleeds (3 patients), intra-tumoural bleeds (3 patients) or both (1 patient). GI tumour sites may have been the source of the GI bleeds (see section 4.4). GI and tumoural bleeding may be serious and sometimes fatal. The most commonly reported (\u2265 10%) drug-related adverse reactions in both settings were mild nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue, myalgia, muscle cramps and rash. Superficial oedemas were a common finding in all studies and were described primarily as periorbital or lower limb oedemas. However, these oedemas were rarely severe and may be managed with diuretics, other supportive measures, or by reducing the dose of Glivec.",
      "When imatinib was combined with high dose chemotherapy in Ph+ ALL patients, transient liver toxicity in the form of transaminase elevation and hyperbilirubinaemia were observed. Considering the limited safety database, the adverse events thus far reported in children are consistent with the known safety profile in adult patients with Ph+ ALL. The safety database for children with Ph+ALL is very limited though no new safety concerns have been identified.",
      "Miscellaneous adverse reactions such as pleural effusion, ascites, pulmonary oedema and rapid weight gain with or without superficial oedema may be collectively described as \u201cfluid retention\u201d. These reactions can usually be managed by withholding Glivec temporarily and with diuretics and other appropriate supportive care measures. However, some of these reactions may be serious or life-threatening and several patients with blast crisis died with a complex clinical history of pleural effusion, congestive heart failure and renal failure. There were no special safety findings in paediatric clinical trials.",

However, the occurrence of cytopenias was also clearly dependent on the stage of the disease, the frequency of grade 3 or 4 neutropenias (ANC < 1.0 x 10/l) and thrombocytopenias (platelet count < 50 x 10/l) being between 4 and 6 times higher in blast crisis and accelerated phase (59\u201364% and 44\u201363% for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively) as compared to newly diagnosed patients in chronic phase CML (16.7% neutropenia and 8.9% thrombocytopenia). In newly diagnosed chronic phase CML grade 4 neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 10/l) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 10 x 10/l) were observed in 3.6% and < 1% of patients, respectively. The median duration of the neutropenic and thrombocytopenic episodes usually ranged from 2 to 3 weeks, and from 3 to 4 weeks, respectively. These events can usually be managed with either a reduction of the dose or an interruption of treatment with Glivec, but can in rare cases lead to permanent discontinuation of treatment. In paediatric CML patients the most frequent toxicities observed were grade 3 or 4 cytopenias involving neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia. These generally occur within the first several months of therapy.",
      "In the study in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST, grade 3 and 4 anaemia was reported in 5.4% and 0.7% of patients, respectively, and may have been related to gastrointestinal or intra-tumoural bleeding in at least some of these patients. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was seen in 7.5% and 2.7% of patients, respectively, and grade 3 thrombocytopenia in 0.7% of patients. No patient developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia.

In GIST patients (study B2222), 6.8% of grade 3 or 4 ALT (alanine aminotransferase) elevations and 4.8% of grade 3 or 4 AST (aspartate aminotransferase) elevations were observed.

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 10 %) with lacosamide treatment were dizziness, headache, nausea and diplopia. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of central nervous system (CNS) and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time.",
      "In all of these controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 12.2 % for patients randomised to lacosamide and 1.6 % for patients randomised to placebo. The most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of lacosamide therapy was dizziness. ",
      "Incidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness may be higher after a loading dose.",
      "Based on the analysis of data from a non-inferiority monotherapy clinical trial comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine controlled release (CR), the most frequently reported adverse reactions (\u2265 10 %) for lacosamide were headache and dizziness. The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 10.6 % for patients treated with lacosamide and 15.6 % for patients treated with carbamazepine CR.",

No second- or higher degree AV Block was seen in these studies. However, cases with second- and third-degree AV Block associated with lacosamide treatment have been reported in post-marketing experience. In the monotherapy clinical trial comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine CR, the extent of increase in PR interval was comparable between lacosamide and carbamazepine.",
      "The incidence rate for syncope reported in pooled adjunctive therapy clinical trials is uncommon and did not differ between lacosamide (n=944) treated epilepsy patients (0.1 %) and placebo (n=364) treated epilepsy patients (0.3 %). In the monotherapy clinical trial comparing lacosamide to carbamazepine CR, syncope was reported in 7/444 (1.6 %) lacosamide patients and in 1/442 (0.2 %) carbamazepine CR patients.",

However, a higher incidence (\u2265 5 % difference) of fall, diarrhoea and tremor has been reported in elderly patients compared to younger adult patients. The most frequent cardiac-related adverse reaction reported in elderly compared to the younger adult population was first-degree AV block. This was reported with lacosamide in 4.8 % (3/62) in elderly patients versus 1.6 % (6/382) in younger adult patients. The discontinuation rate due to adverse events observed with lacosamide was 21.0 % (13/62) in elderly patients versus 9.2 % (35/382) in younger adult patients.

These reactions are dose-dependent, mostly mild to moderate, generally transient and mostly resolve even if treatment is continued.",
      "During clinical studies dose-dependent increases in serum creatinine occurred in about 36% of patients, though most remained within the normal range. Decreases in mean creatinine clearance have been observed in both paediatric and adult patients with beta-thalassemia and iron overload during the first year of treatment, but there is evidence that this does not decrease further in subsequent years of treatment. Elevations of liver transaminases have been reported. Safety monitoring schedules for renal and liver parameters are recommended. Auditory (decreased hearing) and ocular (lens opacities) disturbances are uncommon, and yearly examinations are also recommended (see section 4.4).",

There have been post-marketing reports of metabolic acidosis. The majority of these patients had renal impairment, renal tubulopathy (Fanconi syndrome) or diarrhoea, or conditions where acid-base imbalance is a known complication (see section 4.4).

The observed incidence of the less severe form of neutropenia (neutrophils <1.5x10/l) is 4.9% (2.5 cases per 100 patient-years). This rate should be considered in the context of the underlying elevated incidence of neutropenia in thalassaemia patients, particularly in those with hypersplenism.",
      "Episodes of diarrhoea, mostly mild and transient, have been reported in patients treated with deferiprone. Gastrointestinal effects are more frequent at the beginning of therapy and resolve in most patients within a few weeks without the discontinuation of treatment. In some patients it may be beneficial to reduce the dose of deferiprone and then scale it back up to the former dose. Arthropathy events, which ranged from mild pain in one or more joints to severe arthritis with effusion and significant disability, have also been reported in patients treated with deferiprone. Mild arthropathies are generally transient.",

Episodes of hypotonia, instability, inability to walk, and hypertonia with inability of limb movement, have been reported in children in the post-marketing setting with standard doses of deferiprone.

The incidences of \u201cMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\u201d and \"Renal and urinary disorders\" were lower during combination therapy than monotherapy, whereas the incidence of \u201cCardiac disorders\" was higher during combination therapy than monotherapy. The higher rate of \u201cCardiac disorders\" reported during combination therapy than monotherapy was possibly due to the higher incidence of pre-existing cardiac disorders in patients who received combination therapy. Careful monitoring of cardiac events in patients on combination therapy is warranted (see section 4.4).",

      "In subjects receiving Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 20% of subjects) were fatigue and nausea. The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.2% (5/2,044) and 4.8% (99/2,044) of subjects had ribavirin dose reductions due to adverse reactions.",
      "In subjects receiving Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir without ribavirin, adverse events typically associated to ribavirin (e.g. nausea, insomnia, anaemia) were less frequent and no subjects (0/588) permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.",
      "The safety profile of Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir was similar in patients without cirrhosis, and with compensated cirrhosis, with exception of increased rates of transient hyperbilirubinemia when ribavirin was part of the regimen.",
      "\n\t\t\tTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\t\t",
      "Table 3 lists adverse reactions for which a causal relationship between dasabuvir, in combination with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without ribavirin, and the adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. The majority of adverse reactions presented in Table 3 were of grade 1 severity in Exviera- and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir-containing regimens.",
      "The adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000). ",

      "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSerum ALT elevations\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
      "In a pooled analysis of clinical trials with Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with and without ribavirin, 1% of subjects experienced serum ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) after starting treatment. As the incidence of such elevations was 26% among women taking a concomitant ethinylestradiol-containing medicine, such medicinal products are contraindicated with Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. No increase in incidence of ALT elevations was observed with other types of systemic estrogens commonly used for hormone replacement therapy (e.g., estradiol and conjugated estrogens). ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic, generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment (mean time 20 days, range 8-57 days) and most resolved with ongoing therapy. Two patients discontinued Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir due to elevated ALT, including one on ethinylestradiol. Three interrupted Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for one to seven days, including one on ethinylestradiol. The majority of these ALT elevations were transient and assessed as related to Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir. Elevations in ALT were generally not associated with bilirubin elevations. Cirrhosis was not a risk factor for elevated ALT (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSerum bilirubin elevations \n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
      "Transient elevations in serum bilirubin (predominantly indirect) were observed in subjects receiving Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with ribavirin, related to the inhibition of the bilirubin transporters OATP1B1/1B3 by paritaprevir and ribavirin-induced haemolysis. Bilirubin elevations occurred after initiation of treatment, peaked by study Week 1, and generally resolved with ongoing therapy. Bilirubin elevations were not associated with aminotransferase elevations. The frequency of indirect bilirubin elevations was lower among subjects who did not receive ribavirin.",
      "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLiver transplant recipients\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
      "The overall safety profile in HCV-infected transplant recipients who were administered Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin (in addition to their immunosuppressant medicinal products) was similar to subjects treated with Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and ribavirin in phase 3 clinical trials, although some adverse reactions were increased in frequency. 10 subjects (29.4%) had at least one post baseline haemoglobin value of less than 10 g/dL. 10 of 34 subjects (29.4%) dose modified ribavirin due to decrease in haemoglobin and 2.9% (1/34) had an interruption of ribavirin. Ribavirin dose modification did not impact SVR rates. 5 subjects required erythropoietin, all of whom initiated ribavirin at the starting dose of 1000 to 1200 mg daily. No subject received a blood transfusion.",
      "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHIV/HCV co-infected patients\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
      "The overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. Transient elevations in total bilirubin >3 x ULN (mostly indirect) occurred in 17 (27.0%) subjects; 15 of these subjects were receiving atazanavir. None of the subjects with hyperbilirubinemia had concomitant elevations of aminotransferases.",
      "GT1-infected subjects with or without cirrhosis with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD)",
      "Exviera and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without ribavirin were assessed in 68 subjects with genotype 1 infection with or without cirrhosis who have severe renal impairment or ESRD (see Section 5.1). The overall safety profile in subjects with severe renal impairment was similar to that seen in prior Phase 3 studies in subjects without severe renal impairment, except that a greater proportion of subjects required intervention due to ribavirin-associated decreases in serum haemoglobin. The mean baseline haemoglobin level was 12.1 g/dL and the mean decline in haemoglobin at the end of treatment for subjects taking RBV was 1.2 g/dL.  Thirty-nine of the 50 subjects who received ribavirin required interruption of ribavirin, and 11 of these subjects were also treated with erythropoietin. Four subjects experienced a haemoglobin level < 8 g/dL.  Two subjects received a blood transfusion.  Adverse events of anaemia were not seen in the 18 GT1b-infected subjects who did not receive ribavirin. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with or without Exviera was also evaluated without ribavirin in 18 GT1a- and GT4-infected patients; no adverse events of anaemia were seen in these subjects.",

",
      "The dose related adverse reactions usually disappear spontaneously after a few days or following a temporary reduction in dosage.  The occurrence of CNS adverse reactions may be a manifestation of relative overdosage or significant fluctuation in plasma levels. In such cases it is advisable to monitor the plasma levels and divide the daily dosage into smaller (i.e. 3-4) fractional doses.",

Within each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention (CIOMS III): very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).

Because these reactions are reported voluntary from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency which is therefore categorized as not known. Adverse drug reactions are listed according to system organ class in MedRA. Within each system organ class, ADRs are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.",

In Japanese and European patients, these reactions have been reported to be associated with the use of carbamazepine and the presence of the HLA-A*3101 allele. Another marker, HLA-B*1502 has been shown to be strongly associated with SJS and TEN among individuals of Han Chinese, Thai and some other Asian ancestry (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 for further information).",

The incidence of rash was higher in women compared to men in the etravirine arm in the DUET trials (rash \u2265 grade 2 was reported in 9/60 [15.0%] women versus 51/539 [9.5%] men; discontinuations due to rash were reported in 3/60 [5.0%] women versus 10/539 [1.9%] men) (see section 4.4).

      "The most frequently reported adverse reaction is myelosuppression with neutropenia as the most common manifestation. Bone marrow depression is the dose-limiting toxic effect of hydroxycarbamide. When the maximum tolerated dose is not reached transient myelotoxicity usually occurs in less than 10% of patients, while under the maximum tolerated dose more than 50% can experience reversible bone marrow suppression. These adverse reactions are expected based on the pharmacology of hydroxycarbamide. Gradual dose titration may help to diminish these effects (see section 4.2). ",

Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness:",

The effect on the other lipid parameters analysed (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein-B and lipoprotein-a) was very similar in the two treatment groups. The clinical significance of these results is unclear.",

Patients randomised to the Entresto group received treatment for a median duration of exposure of 24 months; 3,271 patients were treated for more than one year.",

During the enalapril run-in period, 1,102 patients (10.5%) permanently discontinued from the study, 5.6% because of an adverse reaction, most commonly renal dysfunction (1.7%), hyperkalemia (1.7%) and hypotension (1.4%). During the Entresto run-in period, 10.4% of patients permanently discontinued, 5.9% because of an adverse reaction, most commonly renal dysfunction (1.8%), hypotension (1.7%) and hyperkalemia (1.3%). Due to discontinuations during the run-in period, the adverse reaction rates as presented in table below may be lower than the adverse reaction rates expected in clinical practice.",

Median time to first onset of anaemia was approximately 4 weeks (approximately 7 weeks for CTCAE grade \u22653 events). Anaemia was managed with dose interruptions and dose reductions (see section 4.2), and where appropriate with blood transfusions. In SOLO2, the incidence of anaemia adverse reactions was 43.6% (CTCAE grade \u22653 19.5%) and the incidences of dose interruptions, reductions and discontinuations for anaemia were 16.9%, 8.2% and 3.1%, respectively; 17.9% of patients treated with olaparib needed one or more blood transfusions. An exposure-response relationship between olaparib and decreases in haemoglobin has been demonstrated. In clinical studies with Lynparza the incidence of CTCAE grade \u2265 2 shifts (decreases) from baseline in haemoglobin was 20%, absolute neutrophils 15%, platelets 5%, lymphocytes 30% and leucocytes 20% (all % approximate).",

These data are supplemented with the use of levetiracetam in corresponding open-label extension studies, as well as post-marketing experience. The safety profile of levetiracetam is generally similar across age groups (adult and paediatric patients) and across the approved epilepsy indications.  ",

Sixty of these patients were treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies.  In patients aged 4-16 years, a total of 645 patients have been treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled and open label extension studies.  233 of these patients were treated with levetiracetam in placebo-controlled studies.  In both these paediatric age ranges, these data are supplemented with the post-marketing experience of the use of levetiracetam.",

      "The adverse reaction profile of levetiracetam is generally similar across age groups and across the approved epilepsy indications.  Safety results in paediatric patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies were consistent with the safety profile of levetiracetam in adults except for behavioural and psychiatric adverse reactions which were more common in children than in adults.  In children and adolescents aged 4 to 16 years, vomiting (very common, 11.2%), agitation (common, 3.4%), mood swings (common, 2.1%), affect lability (common, 1.7%), aggression (common, 8.2%), abnormal behaviour (common, 5.6%), and lethargy (common, 3.9%) were reported more frequently than in other age ranges or in the overall safety profile.  In infants and children aged 1 month to less than 4 years, irritability (very common, 11.7%) and coordination abnormal (common, 3.3%) were reported more frequently than in other age groups or in the overall safety profile.  ",
      "A double-blind, placebo-controlled paediatric safety study with a non-inferiority design has assessed the cognitive and neuropsychological effects of levetiracetam in children 4 to 16 years of age with partial onset seizures. It was concluded that Keppra was not different (non inferior) from placebo with regard to the change from baseline of the Leiter-R Attention and Memory, Memory Screen Composite score in the per-protocol population. Results related to behavioural and emotional functioning indicated a worsening in levetiracetam treated patients on aggressive behaviour as measured in a standardised and systematic way using a validated instrument (CBCL \u2013 Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist). However subjects, who took levetiracetam in the long-term open label follow-up study, did not experience a worsening, on average, in their behavioural and emotional functioning; in particular measures of aggressive behaviour were not worse than baseline.",

      "In the NVAF studies, the overall incidence of adverse reactions related to bleeding with apixaban was 24.3% in the apixaban vs warfarin study and 9.6% in the apixaban vs acetylsalicylic acid study. In the apixaban vs warfarin study the incidence of ISTH major gastrointestinal bleeds (including upper GI, lower GI, and rectal bleeding) with apixaban was 0.76%/year. The incidence of ISTH major intraocular bleeding with apixaban was 0.18%/year.",

The most commonly observed adverse events are gastrointestinal in nature. In general, the adverse event profile of diclofenac/misoprostol in patients 65 years of age and older (556 subjects) was similar to that of younger patients (1564 subjects). The only clinically relevant differences were that patients 65 years of age and older appeared to be less tolerant to the gastrointestinal effects of diclofenac/misoprostol given three times a day.",

The undesirable effects known to be associated with ganciclovir use can be expected to occur with valganciclovir. All of the adverse drug reactions observed in valganciclovir clinical studies have been previously observed with ganciclovir. Therefore, adverse drug reactions reported with IV or oral ganciclovir (formulation no longer available) or with valganciclovir are included in the table of adverse drug reactions below.",
      "In patients treated with valganciclovir/ganciclovir the most serious and frequent adverse drug reactions are haematological reactions and include neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia \u2013 see section 4.4.",
      "The frequencies presented in the table of adverse reactions are derived from a pooled population of patients (n=1704) receiving maintenance therapy with ganciclovir or valganciclovir. Exception is made for anaphylactic reaction, agranulocytosis and granulocytopenia, the frequencies of which are derived from post-marketing experience. Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (\u2265 1/10), common (\u2265 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (\u2265 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (\u2265 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and very rare (< 1/10,000).",
      "The overall safety profile of ganciclovir/valganciclovir is consistent in HIV and transplant populations except that retinal detachment has only been reported in patients with CMV retinitis. However, there are some differences in the frequency of certain reactions. Valganciclovir is associated with a higher risk of diarrhoea compared to intravenous ganciclovir. Pyrexia, candida infections, depression, severe neutropenia (ANC <500/\u03bcL) and skin reactions are reported more frequently in patients with HIV. Renal and hepatic dysfunction are reported more frequently in organ transplant recipients.",

In patients receiving valganciclovir or oral ganciclovir until Day 100 post-transplant, the incidence of severe neutropenia was 5% and 3% respectively, whilst in patients receiving valganciclovir until Day 200 post-transplant the incidence of severe neutropenia was 10%.

Neutropenia was reported with slightly higher incidence in the two studies conducted in paediatric solid organ transplant patients as compared to adults, but there was no correlation between neutropenia and infectious adverse events in the paediatric population. A higher risk of cytopenias in neonates and infants warrants careful monitoring of blood counts in these age groups (see section 4.4).  ",

      "Unless specified, the following frequency categories were calculated from the number of adverse events reported in a large phase III study conducted in 9366 postmenopausal women patients with operable breast cancer treated for 5 years and unless specified, no account was taken of the frequency within the comparative treatment group or whether the investigator considered it to be related to study medication. The safety findings in the breast cancer prevention trials appeared consistent overall with the established safety profile of tamoxifen.",
      "Table 1 Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) by System Organ Class (SOC) and Frequency.",
      "\n\t\t\t This adverse drug reaction was not reported in the tamoxifen arm (n= 3094) of the above study; however, it has been reported in other trials or from other sources. The frequency has been calculated using the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the point estimate (based on 3/X, where X represents the total sample size e.g. 3094). This is calculated as 3/3094 which equates to a frequency category of 'rare'.",
      "\n\t\t\t The event was not observed in other major clinical studies. The frequency has been calculated using the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the point estimate (based on 3/X, where X represents the total sample size of 13,357 patients in the major clinical studies). This is calculated as 3/13,357 which equates to a frequency category of 'very rare'.",
      "Side effects can be classified as either due to the pharmacological action of the drug, e.g. hot flushes, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, pruritus vulvae and tumour flare, or as more general side effects, e.g. gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, light-headedness and occasionally, fluid retention and alopecia.",
      "When side effects are severe, it may be possible to control them by a simple reduction of dosage (to not less than 20 mg/day) without loss of control of the disease. If side effects do not respond to this measure, it may be necessary to stop the treatment.",
      "Skin rashes (including rare reports of erythema multiforme, Stevens- Johnson syndrome, cutaneous vasculitis and bullous pemphigoid) and commonly hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema have been reported.",
      "Uncommonly, patients with bony metastases have developed hypercalcaemia on initiation of therapy.",
      "Cases of visual disturbances, including rare reports of corneal changes, and common reports of retinopathy have been described in patients receiving tamoxifen therapy. Cataracts have been reported commonly in association with the administration of tamoxifen.",
      "Cases of optic neuropathy and optic neuritis have been reported in patients receiving tamoxifen and, in a small number of cases, blindness has occurred.",
      "Sensory disturbances (including paraesthesia and dysgeusia) have been reported commonly in patients receiving tamoxifen.",
      "Uterine fibroids, endometriosis and other endometrial changes including hyperplasia and polyps have been reported.",
      "Falls in platelet count, usually to 80,000 to 90,000 per cu mm but occasionally lower, have been reported in patients taking tamoxifen for breast cancer.",
      "Leucopenia has been observed following the administration of tamoxifen, sometimes in association with anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Neutropenia has been reported on rare occasions; this can sometimes be severe, and very rarely cases of agranulocytosis have been reported.",
      "There is evidence of ischaemic cerebrovascular events and thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, microvascular thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, occurring commonly during tamoxifen therapy (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). When tamoxifen is used in combination with cytotoxic agents, there is an increased risk of thromboembolic events occurring.",
      "Leg cramps and myalgia have been reported commonly in patients receiving tamoxifen.",
      "Uncommonly, cases of interstitial pneumonitis have been reported.",
      "Tamoxifen has been associated with changes in liver enzyme levels and with a spectrum of more severe liver abnormalities which in some cases were fatal,  including fatty liver, cholestasis and hepatitis, liver failure, cirrhosis, and, hepatocellular injury (including hepatic necrosis).",
      "Commonly, elevation of serum triglyceride levels, in some cases with pancreatitis, may be associated with the use of tamoxifen.",
      "Cystic ovarian swellings have rarely been observed in women receiving tamoxifen.",
      "Vaginal polyps have rarely been observed in women receiving tamoxifen.",
      "Cutaneous lupus erythematosus has been observed very-rarely in patients receiving tamoxifen.",
      "Porphyria cutanea tarda has been observed very-rarely in patients receiving tamoxifen.",
      "Fatigue has been reported very commonly in patients taking tamoxifen. ",
      "Radiation Recall has been observed very rarely in patients receiving tamoxifen.",
      "Uncommonly incidences of endometrial cancer and rare instances of uterine sarcoma (mostly malignant mixed Mullerian tumours) has been reported in association with tamoxifen treatment.",
      "Primary prevention of breast cancer risk",
      "The most common adverse events reported from studies in women at increased risk of breast cancer, and occurring more frequently during treatment with tamoxifen than with placebo, were those associated specifically with the pharmacological action of tamoxifen such as vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats), menstrual abnormalities\\irregularities, vaginal discharge, and vaginal dryness.",
      "In the primary prevention trials tamoxifen significantly increased the incidence of endometrial cancer, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism compared with placebo, but the absolute increase in risk was small. The risk of developing cataracts was also significantly increased with tamoxifen.",
      "Women under 50 years old",
      "A meta-analysis of risk reduction trials stratified by age showed that while women over 50 years old at randomisation had a significantly increased risk of endometrial cancer compared with placebo (RR 3.32, 95% CI 1.95-5.67; p<0.0001), women aged under 50 years did not (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.53-2.65; p=0.6). Similarly, women under 50 years did not have a significantly increased risk of pulmonary embolism compared with placebo (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.55-2.43; p=0.60) and their risk of deep vein thrombosis was only significantly increased during the active treatment phase (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.23- 4.31; p=0,009) but not after treatment had ended.",
      "Gynaecological conditions and procedures",
      "In placebo controlled trials of the use of tamoxifen for the primary reduction of breast cancer risk, benign gynaecological conditions and procedures were more commonly reported with tamoxifen. The IBIS-1 trial found that in 3573 women taking tamoxifen compared to 3566 women on placebo, the following gynaecological conditions and procedures were more common in women taking tamoxifen: abnormal bleeding (842 v 678, p<00001); endometrial polyps (130 v 65, p<0,0001); ovarian cysts (101 v 42, p<00001); hysteroscopy (228 v 138, P<0,0001); pelvic ultrasound (209 v 132, p<00001); dilation and curettage (178 v 94, p<00001); hysterectomy (154 v 104, p=0002) and oophorectomy (103 v 67, p=0006).",

      "The following adverse reactions which may be causally related to the administration of nevirapine have been reported. The frequencies estimated are based on pooled clinical study data for adverse reactions considered related to nevirapine treatment.",
      "Frequency is defined using the following convention: ",
      "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
      "* In study 1100.1090, from which the majority of related adverse events (n=28) were received, patients on placebo had a higher incidence of events of granulocytopenia (3.3%) than patients on nevirapine (2.5%).",
      "** This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised, controlled clinical studies. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to nevirapine in randomised controlled clinical studies (n= 2,718).",
      "*** This adverse reaction was observed in clinical studies with co-administration of tenofovir/emtricitabine.",
      "Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV infected patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra- abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).",
      "Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia and hyperlactataemia (see section 4.4).",
      "The following adverse reactions have also been reported when nevirapine has been used in combination with other anti-retroviral agents: pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy and thrombocytopaenia. These adverse reactions are commonly associated with other antiretroviral agents and may be expected to occur when nevirapine is used in combination with other agents; however it is unlikely that these adverse reactions are due to nevirapine treatment. Hepatic-renal failure syndromes have been reported rarely.",
      "In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).",
      "Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART). The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tSkin and subcutaneous tissues\n\t\t",
      "The most common clinical toxicity of nevirapine is rash, with nevirapine attributable rash occurring in 12.5% of patients in combination regimens in controlled studies.",
      "Rashes are usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the trunk, face and extremities. Hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema and urticaria) have been reported. Rashes occur alone or in the context of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, characterised by rash with constitutional symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, myalgia and lympadenopathy, plus visceral involvement, such as hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, and renal dysfunction.",
      "Severe and life-threatening skin reactions have occurred in patients treated with nevirapine, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Fatal cases of SJS, TEN and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported. The majority of severe rashes occurred within the first 6 weeks of treatment and some required hospitalisation, with one patient requiring surgical intervention (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tHepato-biliary\n\t\t",
      "The most frequently observed laboratory test abnormalities are elevations in liver function tests (LFTs), including ALAT, ASAT, GGT, total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Asymptomatic elevations of GGT levels are the most frequent. Cases of jaundice have been reported. Cases of hepatitis (severe and life-threatening hepatoxicity, including fatal fulminant hepatitis) have been reported in patients treated with nevirapine. The best predictor of a serious hepatic event was elevated baseline liver function tests. The first 18 weeks of treatment is a critical period which requires close monitoring (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\td. Paediatric population\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
      "Based on clinical study experience of 361 paediatric patients the majority of which received combination treatment with ZDV or/and ddI, the most frequently reported adverse events related to nevirapine were similar to those observed in adults. Granulocytopenia was more frequently observed in children. In an open-label clinical study (ACTG 180) granulocytopenia assessed as medicinal product- related occurred in 5/37 (13.5%) of patients. In ACTG 245, a double-blind placebo controlled study, the frequency of serious medicinal product-related granulocytopenia was 5/305 (1.6%). Isolated cases of Stevens- Johnson syndrome or Stevens-Johnson/ toxic epidermal necrolysis transition syndrome have been reported in this population.",

      "The safety profile of regorafenib in these studies was consistent with the safety results of a phase III B study conducted in 2872 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose disease had progressed after treatment with standard therapies.",
      "The most serious adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Stivarga are severe liver injury, haemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation and infection.",

In clinical trials, a higher incidence of severe liver injury with fatal outcome was observed in Japanese patients (~1.5%) treated with Stivarga, compared with non-Japanese patients (<0.1%).",
      "In the placebo-controlled phase III trials, the overall incidence of haemorrhage was 18.2% in patients treated with Stivarga and 9.5% in patients receiving placebo. Most cases of bleeding events in patients treated with Stivarga were mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 and 2: 15.2%), most notably epistaxis (6.1%). Fatal outcome in patients treated with Stivarga was uncommon (0.7%), and included cerebral, respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary events.",

      "\n\t\t\tSummary of the safety profile\n\t\t",
      "The safety summary is based on pooled data from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in more than 2,600 subjects who received Viekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin.",
      "In subjects receiving Viekirax and dasabuvir with ribavirin, the most commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 20% of subjects) were fatigue and nausea. The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0.2% (5/2,044) and 4.8% (99/2,044) of subjects had ribavirin dose reductions due to adverse reactions.",
      "In subjects receiving Viekirax and dasabuvir without ribavirin, adverse events typically associated to ribavirin (e.g. nausea, insomnia, anaemia) were less frequent and no subjects (0/588) permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.",
      "The safety profile of Viekirax and dasabuvir was similar in subjects without cirrhosis, and with compensated cirrhosis with the exception of increased rates of transient hyperbilirubinemia when ribavirin was part of the regimen.",
      "\n\t\t\tTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\t\t",
      "Table 3 lists adverse reactions for which a causal relationship between paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir, in combination with dasabuvir and/or ribavirin, and the adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility.  The majority of adverse reactions presented in Table 3 were of grade 1 severity in Viekirax and dasabuvir-containing regimens.",
      "The adverse reactions are listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (\u22651/10), common (\u22651/100 to <1/10), uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100), rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000) or very rare (<1/10,000).",
      "\n\t\t\tTable 3. Adverse drug reactions identified with Viekirax in combination with dasabuvir with and without ribavirin\n\t\t",
      "*Data set includes all genotype 1-infected subjects in Phase 2 and 3 trials including subjects with cirrhosis.",

      "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSerum ALT elevations\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
      "In a pooled analysis of clinical trials with Viekirax and dasabuvir with and without ribavirin, 1% of subjects experienced serum ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) after starting treatment. As the incidence of such elevations was 26% among women taking a concomitant ethinylestradiol-containing medicinal product, such medicinal products are contraindicated with Viekirax with or without dasabuvir. No increase in incidence of ALT elevations was observed with other types of estrogens commonly used for hormone replacement therapy (e.g. estradiol and conjugated estrogens). ALT elevations were typically asymptomatic, generally occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment (mean time 20 days, range 8-57 days) and most resolved with ongoing therapy. Two patients discontinued Viekirax and dasabuvir due to elevated ALT, including one on ethinylestradiol. Three interrupted Viekirax and dasabuvir for one to seven days, including one on ethinylestradiol. The majority of these ALT elevations were transient and assessed as drug-related. Elevations in ALT were generally not associated with bilirubin elevations. Cirrhosis was not a risk factor for elevated ALT (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSerum bilirubin elevations\n\t\t\t\n\t\t",
      "Transient elevations in serum bilirubin (predominantly indirect) were observed in subjects receiving Viekirax and dasabuvir with ribavirin, related to the inhibition of the bilirubin transporters OATP1B1/1B3 by paritaprevir and ribavirin-induced haemolysis. Bilirubin elevations occurred after initiation of treatment, peaked by study Week 1, and generally resolved with ongoing therapy. Bilirubin elevations were not associated with aminotransferase elevations. The frequency of indirect bilirubin elevations was lower among subjects who did not receive ribavirin.",
      "\n\t\t\tLiver transplant recipients\n\t\t",
      "The overall safety profile in HCV-infected transplant recipients who were administered Viekirax and dasabuvir and ribavirin (in addition to their immunosuppressant medications) was similar to subjects treated with Viekirax and dasabuvir and ribavirin in phase 3 clinical trials, although some adverse reactions were increased in frequency. 10 subjects (29.4%) had at least one post baseline haemoglobin value of less than 10 g/dL. 10 of 34 subjects (29.4%) dose modified ribavirin due to decrease in haemoglobin and 2.9% (1/34) had an interruption of ribavirin. Ribavirin dose modification did not impact SVR rates. 5 subjects required erythropoietin, all of whom initiated ribavirin at the starting dose of 1000 to 1200 mg daily. No subject received a blood transfusion.",
      "\n\t\t\tHIV/HCV co-infected patients\n\t\t",
      "The overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects was similar to that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. Transient elevations in total bilirubin >3 x ULN (mostly indirect) occurred in 17 (27.0%) subjects; 15 of these subjects were receiving atazanavir. None of the subjects with hyperbilirubinemia had concomitant elevations of aminotransferases.",
      "\n\t\t\tGT1-infected subjects with or without cirrhosis with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD)\n\t\t",
      "Viekirax and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin were assessed in 68 subjects with genotype 1 infection with or without cirrhosis who have severe renal impairment or ESRD (see Section 5.1). The overall safety profile in subjects with severe renal impairment was similar to that seen in prior Phase 3 studies in subjects without severe renal impairment, except that a greater proportion of subjects required intervention due to ribavirin-associated decreases in serum haemoglobin. The mean baseline haemoglobin level was 12.1 g/dL and the mean decline in haemoglobin at the end of treatment for subjects taking RBV was 1.2 g/dL.  Thirty-nine of the 50 subjects who received ribavirin required interruption of ribavirin, and 11 of these subjects were also treated with erythropoietin. Four subjects experienced a haemoglobin level < 8 g/dL.  Two subjects received a blood transfusion.  Adverse events of anaemia were not seen in the 18 GT1b-infected subjects who did not receive ribavirin. Viekirax with or without dasabuvir was also evaluated without ribavirin in 18 GT1a- and GT4-infected patients; no adverse events of anaemia were seen in these subjects.",
      "\n\t\t\tPost Marketing Adverse Reactions\n\t\t",

      "The most common adverse reactions observed with Skilarence in the Phase III clinical study (1102) in psoriasis patients were gastrointestinal events (62.7%), flushing (20.8%) and lymphopenia (10.0%). Most adverse reactions were considered mild and did not lead to discontinuation of study treatment. The only adverse reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment in >5% of patients were gastrointestinal reactions. For monitoring recommendations and clinical management of adverse reactions, see section 4.4.",
      "\n\t\t\tTabulated list of adverse reactions\n\t\t",
      "The following is a list of adverse reactions experienced by patients treated with Skilarence during the clinical study and with Fumaderm, a related medicinal product containing dimethyl fumarate along with other fumaric acid esters.",
      "The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).",
      "\n\t\t\tDescription of selected adverse reactions\n\t\t",
      "\n\t\t\tGastrointestinal disturbances\n\t\t",
      "Data from the Phase III clinical study as well as from the literature show that gastrointestinal disorders with dimethyl fumarate-containing products are most likely to occur during the first 2 to 3 months after starting treatment. No apparent dose relationship and no risk factors for the occurrence of these adverse reactions could be identified. Diarrhoea was a common adverse reaction (36.9%) among patients taking Skilarence, leading to medicinal product withdrawal in about 10% of patients. More than 90% of these diarrhoea events were of mild to moderate severity (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tFlushing\n\t\t",
      "Based on observations in the Phase III clinical study as well as on literature data, flushing is most likely to occur during the early weeks of treatment and tends to lessen with time. In the clinical study a total of 20.8% of patients receiving Skilarence experienced flushing, which was mild in the majority of cases (see section 4.4). Published clinical experience with dimethyl fumarate-containing products shows that individual episodes of flushing usually begin shortly after taking the tablets and resolve within a few hours.",
      "\n\t\t\tHaematological changes\n\t\t",
      "Data from the Phase III clinical study as well as from the literature show that changes in haematological parameters are most likely to occur during the first 3 months after starting treatment with dimethyl fumarate. In particular, in the clinical study there was a slight decrease in mean lymphocyte counts starting between weeks 3 and 5 and reaching a maximum in week 12 where approximately one third of patients had lymphocyte values below 1.0x10/L. The mean and median values of lymphocytes remained within the normal range during the clinical study. At week 16 (end of treatment), there was no further decline in lymphocyte counts. At week 16 of treatment, 13/175 (7.4%) of patients were noted to have lymphocyte levels <0.7x 10/L. Blood sampling for safety clinical laboratory tests at follow-up visits was only performed in case of abnormalities at the preceeding visit. During the treatment free follow up, lymphocyte levels of <0.7x 10/L were observed in 1/29 (3.5%) patient at 6 months and 0/28 (0%) at 12 months after stopping treatment. At 12 months after stopping treatment 3/28 (10.7%) of patients had lymphocyte values below 1.0x10/L, which would represent 3/279 (1.1%) of the patients started on Skilarence.",
      "For the total leukocyte count, a decline became apparent at week 12 of treatment; it slowly increased again at week 16 (end of treatment); and 12 months after stopping treatment all patients had values above 3.0x10/L.",
      "A transient increase in mean values of eosinophils was noted as early as week 3, reached a maximum at week 5 and 8, and had returned to baseline values at week 16. ",

The duration of treatment was 12 weeks. The overall frequency of discontinuation in sildenafil treated patients at doses of 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg TID was 2.9%, 3.0% and 8.5% respectively, compared to 2.9% with placebo. Of the 277 subjects treated in the pivotal study, 259 entered a long-term extension study. Doses up to 80 mg three times a day (4 times the recommended dose of 20 mg three times a day) were administered and after 3 years 87% of 183 patients on study treatment were receiving sildenafil 80 mg TID.",

The duration of treatment was 16 weeks. The overall frequency of discontinuations in sildenafil/epoprostenol treated patients due to adverse events was 5.2% compared to 10.7% in the placebo/epoprostenol treated patients. Newly reported adverse reactions, which occurred more frequently in the sildenafil/ epoprostenol group, were ocular hyperaemia, vision blurred, nasal congestion, night sweats, back pain and dry mouth. The known adverse reactions headache, flushing, pain in extremity and oedema were noted in a higher frequency in sildenafil/epoprostenol treated patients compared to placebo/epoprostenol treated patients. Of the subjects who completed the initial study, 242 entered a long-term extension study. Doses up to 80 mg TID were administered and after 3 years 68% of 133 patients on study treatment were receiving sildenafil 80 mg TID.",

The median time to resolution of grade \u22653 (to normalisation or grade <3) was 15 days in the ribociclib plus letrozole treatment group following treatment interruption and/or reduction and/or discontinuation. Febrile neutropenia was reported in about 1.5% of patients exposed to Kisqali in the phase III study. Patients should be instructed to report any fever promptly.",
      "Based on its severity, neutropenia was managed by laboratory monitoring, dose interruption and/or dose modification. Treatment discontinuation due to neutropenia was low (0.9%) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).",

Increases in transaminases were observed. Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT (10.2% versus 1.2%) and AST (6.9% versus 1.5%) were reported in the ribociclib and placebo arms, respectively. Concurrent elevations in ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of normal and total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of normal, with normal alkaline phosphatase, in the absence of cholestasis occurred in 4 (1.2%) patients and all patients recovered to normal levels within 154 days after treatment with Kisqali was discontinued.",
      "Dose interruptions and/or adjustments due to hepatotobiliary toxicity events were reported in 8.4% of ribociclib plus letrozole treated patients, primarily due to ALT increased (5.7%) and/or AST increased (4.5%). Discontinuation of treatment with Kisqali plus letrozole due to abnormal liver function tests or hepatotoxicity occurred in 3.0% and 0.6% of patients respectively (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).",
      "In the phase III clinical study and a phase Ib study with ribociclib plus letrozole treatment, 83.8% (31/37) of grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevation events occurred within the first 6 months of treatment. Among the patients who had grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation, the median time to onset was 57 days for the ribociclib plus letrozole treatment group. The median time to resolution (to normalisation or grade \u22642) was 24 days in the ribociclib plus letrozole group.",

Review of ECG data (average of triplicate) showed 1 patient (0.3%) had >500 msec post-baseline QTcF value, and 9 patients (2.7%) had a >60 msec increase from baseline in QTcF intervals. There were no reported cases of torsade de pointes. Dose interruptions/adjustments were reported in 0.9% of ribociclib plus letrozole treated patients due to electrocardiogram QT prolonged and syncope.",
      "A central analysis of ECG data (average of triplicate) showed 11 patients (3.3%) and 1 patient (0.3%) with at least one >480 msec post-baseline QTcF for the ribociclib plus letrozole arm and the placebo plus letrozole arm respectively. Amongst the patients who had QTcF prolongation >480 msec, the median time to onset was 15 days and these changes were reversible with dose interruption and/or dose reduction (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).",

      "The safety profile is generally consistent among children and adolescents and is also consistent with adult patients.",
      "During the 24-week open-label Phase 3 clinical study of ivacaftor monotherapy in 34 patients aged 2 to less than 6 years (study 7), the incidence of patients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) >3 x ULN was 14.7% (5/34). All 5 patients had maximum ALT or AST levels >8 x ULN, which returned to baseline levels following interruption of dosing with ivacaftor granules. Ivacaftor was permanently discontinued in one patient. In children aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of patients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) >3 x ULN was 15.0% (6/40) in ivacaftor-treated patients and 14.6% (6/41) in patients who received placebo. A single ivacaftor-treated patient (2.5%) in this age range had an elevation of ALT and AST >8 x ULN. Peak LFT (ALT or AST) elevations were generally higher in paediatric patients than in older patients. In almost all instances where dosing was interrupted for elevated transaminases and subsequently resumed, ivacaftor dosing was able to be resumed successfully (see section 4.4). Cases suggestive of positive rechallenge were observed.",
      "During the 24-week, open-label, Phase 3 clinical study in patients aged 12 months to less than 24 months (Study 8), the incidence of patients experiencing transaminase elevations (ALT or AST) >3, >5, and >8 x ULN was 27.8% (5/18), 11.1% (2/18) and 11.1% (2/18), respectively. No patients had elevations in total bilirubin. No patients discontinued ivacaftor treatment due to transaminase elevations. The two patients with elevations of ALT or AST >8 x ULN interrupted treatment and subsequently resumed ivacaftor successfully (see section 4.4 for management of elevated transaminases).",

They are usually triggered by sudden variations in light intensity. Phosphenes may also be described as a halo, image decomposition (stroboscopic or kaleidoscopic effects), coloured bright lights, or multiple image (retinal persistency). The onset of phosphenes is generally within the first two months of treatment after which they may occur repeatedly. Phosphenes were generally reported to be of mild to moderate intensity. All phosphenes resolved during or after treatment, of which a majority (77.5%) resolved during treatment. Fewer than 1% of patients changed their daily routine or discontinued the treatment in relation with phosphenes.",

The observed excess risk of fractures for women on pioglitazone in this study is therefore 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years of use. No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%). Post-marketing, bone fractures have been reported in both male and female patients (see section 4.4).",

      "\n\t\t\t In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea comparator groups.

In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6% higher with pioglitazone than with placebo, when added to therapy that included insulin. . However, this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study. In this study in patients receiving pioglitazone and insulin, a higher percentage of patients with heart failure was observed in patients aged \u2265 65 years compared with those less than 65 years (9.7% compared to 4.0%). In patients on insulin with no pioglitazone the incidence of heart failure was 8.2% in those \u2265 65 years compared to 4.0% in patients less than 65 years. Heart failure has been reported with marketing use of pioglitazone, and more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure (see section 4.4).",

      "Tardive dyskinesia may occur during administration or following withdrawal of Chlorpromazine and other neuroleptic drugs. This syndrome is common among patients treated with moderate to high doses of antipsychotic drugs for prolonged periods of time and may prove irreversible, particularly in patients over the age of 50. It is unlikely to occur in the short-term when low or moderate doses of chlorpromazine are used as recommended, but since its occurrence may be related to duration of treatment as well as daily dose, chlorpromazine should be given in the minimal effective dose for the minimum possible time, unless it is established that long-term administration for the treatment of schizophrenia is required. The potential seriousness and unpredictability of tardive dyskinesia and the fact that it has occasionally been reported to occur when neuroleptic antipsychotic drugs have been prescribed for relatively short periods in low dosage means that the prescribing of such agents requires especially careful assessment of risks versus benefit. Tardive dyskinesia can be precipitated or aggravated by anti-Parkinson drugs. Short-lived dyskinesias may occur after abrupt drug withdrawal. In schizophrenia, the response to antipsychotic drug treatment may be delayed. If drugs are withdrawn, recurrence of symptoms may not become apparent for several weeks or months. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is rare but may occur with any neuroleptic.",
      "Chlorpromazine, even in low dosage in susceptible (especially non-psychotic) individuals, may cause unpleasant subjective feelings of being mentally dulled or slowed down, nausea, dizziness, headache, or paradoxical effects of excitement, agitation, or insomnia. Confusional states or epileptic fits can occur. The effects of chlorpromazine on the heart are dose related. ECG changes, with prolongation of the QT interval and T-wave changes have been commonly reported in patients treated with moderate to high dosage; they are reversible on reducing the dose. In a small number of cases, they have been reported to precede serious arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, which have occurred after overdosage."

The safety analysis included patients from one phase 3 study (MURANO), two phase 2 studies (M13-982 and M14-032), and one phase 1 study (M12-175). MURANO was a randomised, controlled trial in which 194 patients with previously treated CLL received venetoclax in combination with rituximab. In the phase 2 and phase 1 studies, 352 patients with previously treated CLL, which included 212 patients with 17p deletion and 146 patients who had failed a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor were treated with venetoclax monotherapy (see section 5.1).",

All events were laboratory TLS (laboratory abnormalities that met \u22652 of the following criteria within 24 hours of each other: potassium >6 mmol/l, uric acid >476 \u00b5mol/l, calcium <1.75 mmol/l, or phosphorus >1.5 mmol/l; or were reported as TLS events) and occurred in patients who had a lymph node(s) \u22655 cm or ALC \u226525 x 10/l. No TLS with clinical consequences such as acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias or sudden death and/or seizures was observed in these patients. All patients had CrCl \u226550 ml/min.",
      "In the open-label, randomised phase 3 study (MURANO), the incidence of TLS was 3% (6/194) in patients treated with venetoclax + rituximab. After 77/389 patients were enrolled in the study, the protocol was amended to incorporate the current TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures described in Posology (see section 4.2). All events of TLS occurred during the venetoclax dose-titration phase and resolved within two days. All six patients completed the dose titration and reached the recommended daily dose of 400 mg of venetoclax. No clinical TLS was observed in patients who followed the current 5-week dose-titration schedule and TLS prophylaxis and monitoring measures (see section 4.2). The rates of grade \u22653 laboratory abnormalities relevant to TLS were hyperkalaemia 1%, hyperphosphataemia 1%, and hyperuricaemia 1%.",
      "  Neutropenia",
      "  Neutropenia is an identified risk with Venclyxto treatment. In the MURANO study, neutropenia was reported in 61% (all grades) of patients on the venetoclax + rituximab arm. Forty-three percent of patients treated with venetoclax + rituximab experienced dose interruption and 3% of patients discontinued venetoclax due to neutropenia. Grade 3 neutropenia was reported in 32% of patients and grade 4 neutropenia in 26% of patients. The median duration of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 8 days (range: 1-712 days). With venetoclax + rituximab treatment, febrile neutropenia was reported in 4% of patients, grade \u22653 infections in 18%, and serious infections in 21% of patients. ",

The incidence of these undesirable effects is generally higher at the beginning of treatment and decreases with time. ",

Depression was a common psychiatric reaction in clinical trials but seldom required discontinuation of vigabatrin. ",
      "**Rare reports of encephalopathic symptoms such as marked sedation, stupor and confusion in association with non-specific slow wave activity on electroencephalogram have been described soon after the initiation of vigabatrin treatment.  Such reactions have been fully reversible following dose reduction or discontinuation of vigabatrin (see section 4.4).",

Of these patients, 2,264 patients received vildagliptin as monotherapy and 1,520 patients received vildagliptin in combination with another medicinal product. 2,682 patients were treated with vildagliptin 100 mg daily (either 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily) and 1,102 patients were treated with vildagliptin 50 mg once daily.",
      "The majority of adverse reactions in these trials were mild and transient, not requiring treatment discontinuations. No association was found between adverse reactions and age, ethnicity, duration of exposure or daily dose.",
      "Rare cases of hepatic dysfunction (including hepatitis) have been reported. In these cases, the patients were generally asymptomatic without clinical sequelae and liver function returned to normal after discontinuation of treatment. In data from controlled monotherapy and add-on therapy trials of up to 24 weeks in duration, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations \u2265 3x ULN (classified as present on at least 2 consecutive measurements or at the final on-treatment visit) was 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.2% for vildagliptin 50 mg once daily, vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily and all comparators, respectively. These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic, non-progressive in nature and not associated with cholestasis or jaundice.",
      "Rare cases of angioedema have been reported on vildagliptin at a similar rate to controls. A greater proportion of cases were reported when vildagliptin was administered in combination with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-Inhibitor).

In most patients rash resolved with continuing therapy with efavirenz within one month.  Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash.  Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil is restarted.",

In clinical controlled studies of efavirenz, nervous system symptoms of moderate to severe intensity were experienced by 19% (severe 2%) of patients, and 2% of patients discontinued therapy due to such symptoms.  They usually begin during the first one or two days of efavirenz therapy and generally resolve after the first two to four weeks.  They may occur more frequently when Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil is taken concomitantly with meals possibly due to increased efavirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2).  Dosing at bedtime seems to improve the tolerability of these symptoms (see section 4.2).",
      "\n\t\t\tHepatic failure with efavirenz: Hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, as reported post-marketing, were sometimes characterised by a fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death.",
      "\n\t\t\tRenal impairment: As Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil may cause renal damage, monitoring of renal function is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 Summary of the safety profile).  Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  However, in some patients, declines in creatinine clearance did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation.  Patients at risk of renal impairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete recovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tInteraction with didanosine: Co-administration of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended as it results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-related adverse reactions (see section 4.5). Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported.",

Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease and autoimmune disorders) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tOsteonecrosis: Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART.  The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).",

      "\n\t\t\tThis adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance for either efavirenz, emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical calculation based on the total number of patients treated with efavirenz in clinical trials (n = 3,969) or exposed to emtricitabine in randomised controlled clinical trials (n = 1,563) or exposed to tenofovir disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical trials and the expanded access programme (n = 7,319).",

      "In clinical trials of efavirenz, rashes were usually mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions that occurred within the first two weeks of initiating therapy with efavirenz. In most patients rash resolved with continuing therapy with efavirenz within one month. The combination efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil can be reinitiated in patients interrupting therapy because of rash. Use of appropriate antihistamines and/or corticosteroids is recommended when the combination efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is restarted.",

      "Nervous system symptoms are common with efavirenz, one of the components of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva. In clinical controlled studies of efavirenz, nervous system symptoms of moderate to severe intensity were experienced by 19% (severe 2%) of patients, and 2% of patients discontinued therapy due to such symptoms. They usually begin during the first one or two days of efavirenz therapy and generally resolve after the first two to four weeks. They may occur more frequently when efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is taken concomitantly with meals possibly due to increased efavirenz plasma levels (see section 5.2). Dosing at bedtime seems to improve the tolerability of these symptoms (see section 4.2).",
      "\n\t\t\tHepatic failure with efavirenz\n\t\t",
      "Hepatic failure, including cases in patients with no pre-existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors, as reported post-marketing, were sometimes characterised by a fulminant course, progressing in some cases to transplantation or death.",
      "\n\t\t\tRenal impairment\n\t\t",
      "As efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil may cause renal damage, monitoring of renal function is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 Summary of the safety profile). Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. However, in some patients, declines in creatinine clearance did not completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. Patients at risk of renal impairment (such as patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete recovery of renal function despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4).",

      "Co-administration of Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva and didanosine is not recommended as it results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-related adverse reactions (see section 4.5). Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported.",

      "In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tOsteonecrosis\n\t\t",
      "Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).",

      "\n\t\t\tElderly\n\t\t",
      "The combination of efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in patients over the age of 65. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic or renal function, therefore caution should be exercised when treating elderly patients with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva (see section 4.2).",
      "\n\t\t\tPatients with renal impairment\n\t\t",
      "Since tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is recommended in any patient with mild renal impairment treated with Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).",

The adverse reaction profile of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil in patients co-infected with HIV/HBV or HIV/HCV was similar to that observed in patients infected with HIV without co-infection. However, as would be expected in this patient population, elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently than in the general HIV infected population.",

      "Due to the pharmacological mode of action, the use of Xarelto may be associated with an increased risk of occult or overt bleeding from any tissue or organ which may result in post haemorrhagic anaemia. The signs, symptoms, and severity (including fatal outcome) will vary according to the location and degree or extent of the bleeding and/or anaemia (see section 4.9 \u201cManagement of bleeding\u201d). In the clinical studies mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genito urinary including abnormal vaginal or increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequently during long term rivaroxaban treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate. The risk of bleedings may be increased in certain patient groups, e.g. those patients with uncontrolled severe arterial hypertension and/or on concomitant treatment affecting haemostasis (see section 4.4 \u201cHaemorrhagic risk\u201d). Menstrual bleeding may be intensified and/or prolonged. Haemorrhagic complications may present as weakness, paleness, dizziness, headache or unexplained swelling, dyspnoea and unexplained shock. In some cases as a consequence of anaemia, symptoms of cardiac ischaemia like chest pain or angina pectoris have been observed. ",
      "Known complications secondary to severe bleeding such as compartment syndrome and renal failure due to hypoperfusion have been reported for Xarelto. Therefore, the possibility of haemorrhage is to be considered in evaluating the condition in any anticoagulated patient.",

Along with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), in some studies, Kaletra was used in combination with efavirenz or nevirapine.",

The risk of diarrhoea may be greater with once-daily dosing of Kaletra.  Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting may occur at the beginning of the treatment while hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolemia may occur later.  Treatment emergent adverse events led to premature study discontinuation for 7% of subjects from Phase II-IV studies.",

      "\n\t\t\tSeizures: The incidence of seizure in naltrexone / bupropion over the course of the clinical program was 0.06% (2/3239 subjects). Among the group of subjects treated with naltrexone / bupropion, both cases of seizures were considered as serious and led to treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). There were no cases of seizures in the placebo group.",
      "\n\t\t\tGastrointestinal adverse reactions: The vast majority of subjects treated with naltrexone / bupropion who experienced nausea reported the event within 4 weeks of starting treatment. Events were generally self-limited; the majority of events resolved within 4 weeks and almost all resolved by Week 24. Similarly, the majority of events of constipation in subjects treated with naltrexone/bupropion were reported during the dose escalation phase. The time to resolution of constipation was similar between subjects treated with naltrexone / bupropion and subjects treated with placebo. Approximately half of the subjects treated with naltrexone / bupropion who experienced vomiting first reported the event during the dose escalation phase. Time to resolution for vomiting was typically rapid (within one week) and almost all events resolved within 4 weeks. The incidence of these common gastrointestinal adverse reactions in naltrexone / bupropion versus placebo was as follows: nausea (31.8% vs. 6.7%), constipation (18.1% vs. 7.2%), and vomiting (9.9% vs. 2.9%). The incidence of severe nausea, severe constipation, and severe vomiting was low, but was higher in subjects treated with naltrexone / bupropion compared to subjects treated with placebo (severe nausea: naltrexone / bupropion 1.9%, placebo <0.1%; severe constipation: naltrexone / bupropion 0.6%, placebo 0.1%; severe vomiting: naltrexone / bupropion 0.7%, placebo 0.3%). No events of nausea, constipation, or vomiting were considered serious.",
      "\n\t\t\tOther frequent adverse reactions: The majority of subjects treated with naltrexone / bupropion who reported dizziness, headache, insomnia, or dry mouth, first reported these events during the dose escalation phase. Dry mouth may be associated with toothache and dental caries; in the subset of patients with dry mouth, a higher incidence of toothache and dental caries were observed in subjects treated with naltrexone / bupropion compared to subjects treated with placebo. The incidence of severe headache, severe dizziness, and severe insomnia was low, but was higher in subjects treated with naltrexone / bupropion compared to subjects treated with placebo (severe headache: naltrexone / bupropion 1.1%, placebo 0.3%; severe dizziness: naltrexone / bupropion 0.6%, placebo 0.2%; severe insomnia: naltrexone / bupropion 0.4%, placebo <0.1%).

      "Elderly patients may be more sensitive to some of the central nervous system-related adverse reactions of naltrexone / bupropion (primarily dizziness and tremor). There is an increased incidence of gastrointestinal disorders with higher age categories. Common events leading to withdrawal among elderly were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, constipation.",
      "\n\t\t\tType 2 diabetes\n\t\t",
      "Patients with type 2 diabetes treated with naltrexone / bupropion demonstrated a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events, primarily nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, than subjects without diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes may be more prone to these events due to concomitant medicinal product use (e.g., metformin) or may be more likely to have underlying gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., gastroparesis) predisposing to gastrointestinal symptoms.",
      "\n\t\t\tRenal impairment\n\t\t",

      "Teriflunomide is the main metabolite of leflunomide. The safety profile of leflunomide in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis may be pertinent when prescribing teriflunomide in MS patients.",
      "The placebo-controlled pooled analysis was based on 2047 patients with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis treated with teriflunomide once daily. Within this safety population, the most commonly reported adverse reactions in the teriflunomide treated patients were: headache, diarrhoea, increased ALT, nausea, and alopecia. In general, headache, diarrhoea, nausea and alopecia, were mild to moderate, transient and infrequently led to treatment discontinuation. ",

Frequencies were defined using the following convention: very common (\u22651/10); common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are ranked in order of decreasing seriousness. ",

      "Alopecia was reported as hair thinning, decreased hair density, hair loss, associated or not with hair texture change, in 13.9% of patients treated with 14 mg teriflunomide versus 5.1% in patients treated with placebo. Most cases were described as diffuse or generalised over the scalp (no complete hair loss reported) and occurred most often during the first 6 months and with resolution in 121 of 139 (87.1%) patients treated with teriflunomide 14 mg. Discontinuation because of alopecia was 1.3% in the teriflunomide 14 mg teriflunomide group, versus 0.1% in the placebo group. ",

      "Mild increases in transaminase, ALT below or equal to 3-fold ULN were more frequently seen in teriflunomide-treated groups as compared to placebo. The frequency of elevations above 3-fold ULN and higher was balanced across treatment groups. These elevations in transaminase occurred mostly within the first 6 months of treatment and were reversible after treatment cessation. The recovery time varied between months and years.",

      "A mean decrease affecting white blood cell (WBC) count (<15% from baseline levels, mainly neutrophil and lymphocytes decrease) was observed in placebo-controlled trials with AUBAGIO, although a greater decrease was observed in some patients. The decrease in mean count from baseline occurred during the first 6 weeks then stabilised over time while on-treatment but at decreased levels (less than a 15% decrease from baseline). The effect on red blood cell (RBC) (<2%) and platelet counts (<10%) was less pronounced.",

      "In placebo-controlled studies, peripheral neuropathy, including both polyneuropathy and mononeuropathy (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), was reported more frequently in patients taking teriflunomide than in patients taking placebo. In the pivotal, placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of peripheral neuropathy confirmed by nerve conduction studies was 1.9% (17 patients out of 898) on 14 mg of teriflunomide, compared with 0.4% (4 patients out of 898) on placebo. Treatment was discontinued in 5 patients with peripheral neuropathy on teriflunomide 14 mg. Recovery following treatment discontinuation was reported in 4 of these patients.",

This represents a heterogeneous population, containing patients with haematological malignancy, HIV- infected patients with oesophageal candidiasis and refractory fungal infections, non-neutropenic patients with candidaemia or aspergillosis and healthy volunteers. ",
      "The most commonly reported adverse reactions were visual impairment, pyrexia, rash, vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, headache, peripheral oedema, liver function test abnormal, respiratory distress and abdominal pain.",
      "The severity of the adverse reactions was generally mild to moderate. No clinically significant differences were seen when the safety data were analysed by age, race, or gender. ",

      "Frequency categories are expressed as: Very common (\u22651/10); Common (\u22651/100 to <1/10); Uncommon (\u22651/1,000 to <1/100); Rare (\u22651/10,000 to <1/1,000); Very rare (<1/10,000); Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).",

      "In the combined data from three bioequivalence studies using the powder for oral suspension formulation, treatment-related taste perversion was recorded in 12 (14%) of subjects.",
      " Visual impairments",
      "In clinical trials, visual impairments (including blurred vision, photophobia, chloropsia, chromatopsia, colour blindness, cyanopsia, eye disorder, halo vision, night blindness, oscillopsia, photopsia, scintillating scotoma, visual acuity reduced, visual brightness, visual field defect, vitreous floaters, and xanthopsia) with voriconazole were very common. These visual impairments were transient and fully reversible, with the majority spontaneously resolving within 60 minutes and no clinically significant long-term visual effects were observed. There was evidence of attenuation with repeated doses of voriconazole. The visual impairments were generally mild, rarely resulted in discontinuation and were not associated with long-term sequelae. Visual impairments may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses.  ",
      "The mechanism of action is unknown, although the site of action is most likely to be within the retina.  In a study in healthy volunteers investigating the impact of voriconazole on retinal function, voriconazole caused a decrease in the electroretinogram (ERG) waveform amplitude. The ERG measures electrical currents in the retina. The ERG changes did not progress over 29 days of treatment and were fully reversible on withdrawal of voriconazole.",
      "There have been post-marketing reports of prolonged visual adverse events (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tDermatological reactions \n\t\t",
      "Dermatological reactions were very common in patients treated with voriconazole in clinical trials, but these patients had serious underlying diseases and were receiving multiple concomitant medicinal products. The majority of rashes were of mild to moderate severity.  Patients have developed severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) (uncommon), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) (rare), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) (rare) and erythema multiforme (rare) during treatment with VFEND (see section 4.4).\n",
      "If a patient develops a rash they should be monitored closely and VFEND discontinued if lesions progress. Photosensitivity reactions such as ephelides, lentigo and actinic keratosis have been reported, especially during long-term therapy (see section 4.4).",
      "There have been reports of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in patients treated with VFEND for long periods of time; the mechanism has not been established (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tLiver function tests\n\t\t",
      "The overall incidence of transaminase increases >3 xULN (not necessarily comprising an adverse event) in the voriconazole clinical programme was 18.0 % (319/1,768) in adults and 25.8% (73/283) in paediatric subjects who received voriconazole for pooled therapeutic and prophylaxis use. Liver function test abnormalities may be associated with higher plasma concentrations and/or doses. The majority of abnormal liver function tests either resolved during treatment without dose adjustment or following dose adjustment, including discontinuation of therapy.",
      "Voriconazole has been associated with cases of serious hepatic toxicity in patients with other serious underlying conditions. This includes cases of jaundice, hepatitis and hepatic failure leading to death (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tInfusion-related reactions\n\t\t",
      "During infusion of the intravenous formulation of voriconazole in healthy subjects, anaphylactoid-type reactions, including flushing, fever, sweating, tachycardia, chest tightness, dyspnoea, faintness, nausea, pruritus and rash have occurred. Symptoms appeared immediately upon initiating the infusion (see section 4.4).",
      "\n\t\t\tProphylaxis\n\t\t",
      "In an open-label, comparative, multicenter study comparing voriconazole and itraconazole as primary prophylaxis in adult and adolescent allogeneic HSCT recipients without prior proven or probable IFI, permanent discontinuation of voriconazole due to AEs was reported in 39.3% of subjects versus 39.6% of subjects in the itraconazole arm. Treatment-emergent hepatic AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation of study medication for 50 subjects (21.4%) treated with voriconazole and for 18 subjects (7.1%) treated with itraconazole. ",
      "\n\t\t\tPaediatric population\n\t\t",
      "The safety of voriconazole was investigated in 288 paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years (169) and 12 to <18 years (119) who received voriconazole for prophylaxis (183) and therapeutic use (105) in clinical trials. The safety of voriconazole was also investigated in 158 additional paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years in compassionate use programs. Overall, the safety profile of voriconazole in paediatric populationwas similar to that in adults. However, a trend towards a higher frequency of liver enzyme elevations, reported as adverse events in clinical trials was observed in paediatric patients as compared to adults (14.2% transaminases increased in paediatrics compared to 5.3% in adults). Post-marketing data suggest there might be a higher occurrence of skin reactions (especially erythema) in the paediatric population compared to adults.  In the 22 patients less than 2 years old who received voriconazole in a compassionate use programme, the following adverse reactions (for which a relationship to voriconazole could not be excluded) were reported: photosensitivity reaction (1), arrhythmia (1), pancreatitis (1), blood bilirubin increased (1), hepatic enzymes increased (1), rash (1) and papilloedema (1). There have been post-marketing reports of pancreatitis in paediatric patients. ",

The most commonly reported adverse reactions overall were headache, dizziness, fatigue, and somnolence. The most common adverse reactions observed at a higher incidence than placebo in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were somnolence and vomiting. Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity. The discontinuation rate in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome due to adverse reactions was 8.2% for patients receiving rufinamide and 0% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation from the rufinamide treatment group were rash and vomiting.",

The most frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide treatment group (occurring in \u226510% of subjects) were upper respiratory tract infection and vomiting (28.0% each), pneumonia and somnolence (20.0% each), sinusitis, otitis media, diarrhoea, cough and pyrexia (16.0% each), and bronchitis, constipation, nasal congestion, rash, irritability and decreased appetite (12.0% each). The frequency, type and severity of these adverse reactions were similar to that in children 4 years of age and older, adolescents and adults. Age characterisation in patients less than 4 years was not identified in the limited safety database due to small number of patients in the study.",

The most common adverse reaction was dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions with this treatment was not affected by gender, age, or race. Adverse reactions were reported at a similar frequency for the Edarbi 20 mg dose as with the 40 and 80 mg doses in one placebo controlled study.",

The elevations in serum creatinine during coadminstiration of Edarbi with diuretics were associated with larger blood pressure reductions compared with a single medicinal product. Many of these elevations were transient or nonprogressive while subjects continued to receive treatment. Following discontinuation of treatment, the majority of the elevations that had not resolved during treatment were reversible, with the creatinine levels of most subjects returning to baseline or near-baseline values.",

      "There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions and central nervous system (CNS) effects (e.g. somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Monitoring the patient for increased CNS pharmacological effects is suggested (see section 4.5).",
      "There have been rare reports of clarithromycin ER tablets in the stool, many of which have occurred in patients with anatomic (including ileostomy or colostomy) or functional gastrointestinal disorders with shortened GI transit times. In several reports, tablet residues have occurred in the context of diarrhea.

      "In adult patients, the most frequently reported adverse reactions by patients treated with total daily doses of 1,000 mg and 2,000 mg of clarithromycin were: nausea, vomiting, taste perversion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, flatulence, headache, constipation, hearing disturbance, Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) and Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) elevations. Additional low-frequency events included dyspnoea, insomnia and dry mouth. The incidences were comparable for patients treated with 1,000 mg and 2,000 mg, but were generally about 3 to 4 times as frequent for those patients who received total daily doses of 4,000 mg of clarithromycin.",
      "In these immunocompromised patients, evaluations of laboratory values were made by analysing those values outside the seriously abnormal level (i.e. the extreme high or low limit) for the specified test. On the basis of these criteria, about 2% to 3% of those patients who received 1,000 mg or 2,000 mg of clarithromycin daily had seriously abnormal elevated levels of SGOT and SGPT, and abnormally low white blood cell and platelet counts. A lower percentage of patients in these two dosage groups also had elevated Blood Urea Nitrogen levels. Slightly higher incidences of abnormal values were noted for patients who received 4,000 mg daily for all parameters except White Blood Cell.",

In the three 12-week phase 3 double blind, placebo controlled studies, 88% of the patients completed treatment with this medicinal product, and 4% of the patients discontinued due to adverse events. Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity.",
      "The most common adverse reactions reported for patients treated with Betmiga 50 mg during the three 12-week phase 3 double blind, placebo controlled studies are tachycardia and urinary tract infections. The frequency of tachycardia was 1.2% in patients receiving Betmiga 50 mg. Tachycardia led to discontinuation in 0.1% patients receiving Betmiga 50 mg. The frequency of urinary tract infections was 2.9% in patients receiving Betmiga 50 mg. Urinary tract infections led to discontinuation in none of the patients receiving Betmiga 50 mg. Serious adverse reactions included atrial fibrillation (0.2%).",

One patient (0.2%) on therapy and 2 patients (0.4%) on placebo permanently discontinued treatment for elevated transaminases.

      "In PEGASUS, TIMI Major bleeding for ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily was higher than for ASA alone. No increased bleeding risk was seen for fatal bleeding and only a minor increase was observed in intracranial haemorrhages, as compared to ASA therapy alone. There were few fatal bleeding events in the study, 11 (0.3%) for ticagrelor 60 mg and 12 (0.3%) for ASA therapy alone. The observed increased risk of TIMI Major bleeding with ticagrelor 60 mg was primarily due to a higher frequency of Other TIMI Major bleedings driven by events in the gastrointestinal SOC.",
      "Increased bleeding patterns similar to TIMI Major were seen for TIMI Major or Minor and PLATO Major and PLATO Major or Minor bleeding categories (see Table 3). Discontinuation of treatment due to bleeding was more common with ticagrelor 60 mg compared to ASA therapy alone (6.2% and 1.5%, respectively). The majority of these bleedings were of less severity (classified as TIMI Requiring medical attention), e.g. epistaxis, bruising and haematomas.",
      "The bleeding profile of ticagrelor 60 mg was consistent across multiple pre-defined subgroups (e.g. by age, gender, weight, race, geographic region, concurrent conditions, concomitant therapy and medical history) for TIMI Major, TIMI Major or Minor and PLATO Major bleeding events.",
      "\n\t\t\tIntracranial bleeding: Spontaneous ICHs were reported in similar rates for ticagrelor 60 mg and ASA therapy alone (n=13, 0.2% in both treatment groups). Traumatic and procedural ICHs showed a minor increase with ticagrelor 60 mg treatment, (n=15, 0.2%) compared with ASA therapy alone (n=10, 0.1%). There were 6 fatal ICHs with ticagrelor 60 mg and 5 fatal ICHs with ASA therapy alone. The incidence of intracranial bleeding was low in both treatment groups given the significant comorbidity and CV risk factors of the population under study.",
      "\n\t\t\tDyspnoea\n\t\t",
      "Dyspnoea, a sensation of breathlessness, is reported by patients treated with ticagrelor. In PLATO, dyspnoea adverse events (AEs) (dyspnoea, dyspnoea at rest, dyspnoea exertional, dyspnoea paroxysmal nocturnal and nocturnal dyspnoea), when combined, was reported by 13.8% of patients treated with ticagrelor and by 7.8% of patients treated with clopidogrel. In 2.2% of patients taking ticagrelor and by 0.6% taking clopidogrel investigators considered the dyspnoea causally related to treatment in the PLATO study and few were serious (0.14% ticagrelor; 0.02% clopidogrel), (see section 4.4). Most reported symptoms of dyspnoea were mild to moderate in intensity, and most were reported as a single episode early after starting treatment. ",
      "Compared with clopidogrel, patients with asthma/COPD treated with ticagrelor may have an increased risk of experiencing non-serious dyspnoea (3.29% ticagrelor versus 0.53% clopidogrel) and serious dyspnoea (0.38% ticagrelor versus 0.00% clopidogrel). In absolute terms, this risk was higher than in the overall PLATO population. Ticagrelor should be used with caution in patients with history of asthma and/or COPD (see section 4.4).",
      "About 30% of episodes resolved within 7 days. PLATO included patients with baseline congestive heart failure, COPD or asthma; these patients, and the elderly, were more likely to report dyspnoea. For ticagrelor, 0.9% of patients discontinued study active substance because of dyspnoea compared with 0.1% taking clopidogrel. The higher incidence of dyspnoea with ticagrelor is not associated with new or worsening heart or lung disease (see section 4.4). Ticagrelor does not affect tests of pulmonary function.",
      "In PEGASUS, dyspnoea was reported in 14.2% of patients taking ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily and in 5.5% of patients taking ASA alone. As in PLATO, most reported dyspnoea was mild to moderate in intensity (see section 4.4). Patients who reported dyspnoea tended to be older and more frequently had dyspnoea, COPD or asthma at baseline.",
      "\n\t\t\tInvestigations \n\t\t",
      "Uric acid elevations: In PLATO, serum uric acid increased to more than upper limit of normal in 22% of patients receiving ticagrelor compared to 13% of patients receiving clopidogrel. The corresponding numbers in PEGASUS were 9.1%, 8.8% and 5.5% for ticagrelor 90 mg, 60 mg and placebo, respectively. Mean serum uric acid increased approximately 15% with ticagrelor compared to approximately 7.5% with clopidogrel and after treatment was stopped, decreased to approximately 7% on ticagrelor but with no decrease observed for clopidogrel. In PEGASUS, a reversible increase in mean serum uric acid levels of 6.3% and 5.6% was found for ticagrelor 90 mg and 60 mg, respectively, compared to a 1.5% decrease in the placebo group. In PLATO, the frequency of gouty arthritis was 0.2% for ticagrelor vs. 0.1% for clopidogrel. The corresponding numbers for gout/gouty arthritis in PEGASUS were 1.6%, 1.5% and 1.1% for ticagrelor 90 mg, 60 mg and placebo, respectively.",

The clinically relevant adverse reactions observed in the CAPRIE, CURE, CLARITY, COMMIT and ACTIVE-A studies are discussed below. In addition to clinical studies experience, adverse reactions have been spontaneously reported.",

Major bleeding was mostly of extracranial origin in both groups (5.3% in the clopidogrel + ASA group; 3.5% in the placebo +ASA group), mainly from the gastrointestinal tract (3.5% vs. 1.8%). There was an excess of intracranial bleeding in the clopidogrel + ASA treatment group compared to the placebo + ASA group (1.4% versus 0.8%, respectively).

Overall, clopidogrel 75 mg/day was comparable to ASA 325 mg/day in CAPRIE regardless of age, gender and race. The clinically relevant adverse reactions observed in the CAPRIE, CURE, CLARITY, COMMIT and ACTIVE-A studies are discussed below. In addition to clinical studies experience, adverse reactions have been spontaneously reported. ",
      "Bleeding is the most common reaction reported both in clinical studies as well as in post-marketing experience where it was mostly reported during the first month of treatment. ",
      "In CAPRIE, in patients treated with either clopidogrel or ASA, the overall incidence of any bleeding was 9.3%. The incidence of severe cases was similar for clopidogrel and ASA. ",
      "In CURE, there was no excess in major bleeds with clopidogrel plus ASA within 7 days after coronary bypass graft surgery in patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to surgery. In patients who remained on therapy within five days of bypass graft surgery, the event rate was 9.6% for clopidogrel plus ASA, and 6.3% for placebo plus ASA. ",
      "In CLARITY, there was an overall increase in bleeding in the clopidogrel plus ASA group vs. the placebo plus ASA group .The incidence of major bleeding was similar between groups . This was consistent across subgroups of patients defined by baseline characteristics, and type of fibrinolytic or heparin therapy. ",
      "In COMMIT, the overall rate of noncerebral major bleeding or cerebral bleeding was low and similar in both groups. ",
      "In ACTIVE-A, the rate of major bleeding was greater in the clopidogrel + ASA group than in the placebo + ASA group (6.7% versus 4.3%). Major bleeding was mostly of extracranial origin in both groups (5.3% in the clopidogrel + ASA group; 3.5% in the placebo +ASA group), mainly from the gastrointestinal tract (3.5% vs. 1.8%). There was an excess of intracranial bleeding in the clopidogrel + ASA treatment group compared to the placebo + ASA group (1.4% versus 0.8%, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of fatal bleeding (1.1% in the clopidogrel + ASA group and 0.7% in the placebo +ASA group) and haemorrhagic stroke (0.8% and 0.6%, respectively) between groups.

      "For the most part, the adverse event profile of clozapine is predictable from its pharmacological properties. An important exception is its propensity to cause agranulocytosis (see section 4.4). Because of this risk, its use is restricted to treatment-resistant schizophrenia and psychosis occurring during the course of Parkinson's disease in cases where standard treatment has failed. While blood monitoring is an essential part of the care of patients receiving clozapine, the physician should be aware of other rare but serious adverse reactions, which may be diagnosed in the early stages only by careful observation and questioning of the patient in order to prevent morbidity and mortality. ",
      "The most serious adverse reactions experienced with clozapine are agranulocytosis, seizure, cardiovascular effects and fever (see section 4.4). The most common side effects are drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, tachycardia, constipation, and hypersalivation. ",
      "Data from the clinical trials experience showed that a varying proportion of clozapine-treated patients (from 7.1 to 15.6%) were discontinued due to an adverse event, including only those that could be reasonably attributed to clozapine.

Although generally reversible on withdrawal of treatment, agranulocytosis may result in sepsis and can prove fatal. Because immediate withdrawal of treatment is required to prevent the development of life-threatening agranulocytosis, monitoring of the WBC count is mandatory (see section 4.4). Table 3 below summarises the estimated incidence of agranulocytosis for each Clozaril treatment period.",

Glucose levels normalised in most patients after discontinuation of Clozaril and in a few cases hyperglycaemia recurred when treatment was reinitiated.

It lowers the seizure threshold in a dose-dependent manner and may induce myoclonic jerks or generalised seizures. These symptoms are more likely to occur with rapid dose increases and in patients with pre-existing epilepsy. In such cases the dose should be reduced and, if necessary, anticonvulsant treatment initiated. Carbamazepine should be avoided because of its potential to depress bone marrow function, and with other anticonvulsant the possibility of a pharmacokinetic interaction should be considered. In rare cases, patients treated with Clozaril may experience delirium. ",
