      "rare instances of massive ovarian enlargement are recorded. such an instance has been described in a patient with polycystic ovary syndrome whose clomid 50mg tablets therapy consisted of 100mg daily for 14 days. abnormal ovarian enlargement usually regresses spontaneously; most of the patients with this condition should be treated conservatively.",
